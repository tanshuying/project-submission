I have 192k in cash that I’ve considered paying off the mortgage with but with rates so high I’d rather put it in an investment earning a higher rate than the mortgage.

My monthly free cash flow is rather tight so I’m not going to invest in anything with risk. (I have risk in my IRA’s)

I’ve been looking at these option…Schwab’s money market fund SWVXX, SGOV ETF, 1 year Cd earning 4.85% and also considering laddering 3, 6, 9 and 12 month t bills with an average yield of 4.78. 

As long at rates stay higher than the mortgage I won’t pay it off. If they drop below, I will.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello,

This is on behalf of my dad. He’s not the most financially literate person. He worked a government job for 20+ years and has a pension and social security. His take home pay is something around $3K a month I think. He has an $1100 mortgage and owes probably close to $250K. My mom passed away a couple years ago and she had a life insurance policy and so he got $250K. I asked him today where he has the money because it came up in conversation and he said in a Chase savings account lol. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Literally $25 per year in interest. I immediately told him to open up a HYSA and explained to him that he could be making an extra $600+ per month with his money. He said he would “check it out”, which basically means he doesn’t trust it, I’m assuming. He’s super paranoid about everything.

I know damn well I’d never get this man to invest into any index fund or anything with this money. He thinks all investing is gambling and I’m not even going to try. Any advice on this? I’d like to have that money growing in the safest way possible so that if he has health problems later on he can pull from that.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi everyone, myself and my wife are fairly young in our late 20s and have a great relationship with my parents. We have a 270k HHI and around 350k in cash as well as own our primary residence home which we have 15% equity and a price of 450k at a 3% 30 yr rate. My parents live alone in a larger 4000+ sqft home with 6 beds 5 baths on the best lot of a golf course backyard- I’ll most likely be inheriting this home in the future as my own primary residence - probably valued at around 1mil which I helped cosign with them and bought at 700k list at a 2.75% 30 yr rate. They have enough cash to pay off the home outright, but why bother when rates are so low. 

Okay so enough of the back story, basically I calculated with our current housing expenses of around 3k+ a month we will need around 1.5mil to fire which could take us 6-7 years if we save 100k a year with 7% annual growth. If I move back in with my parents, we’ll basically have the one side of the home to ourselves and I am planning to break down two rooms and renovate into a master suite. At the end of the day, our cost of living will go down substantially, which will allow us to FIRE years earlier as well as always having less financial stress because we know we have good careers and my parents have good financial backing as well. My wife and my goal once we retire is to travel the world as much as we can while working two less demanding remote jobs that we are overqualified for so the work can be done quick.

Would you move back in with your parents knowing your relationship with them is very respectful &amp; healthy and that it will allow you to retire much earlier?

How does a person typically diversify their 401k/IRA outside of keeping it in a TDF? Should partial be in T-bills?

My wife has a vehicle that is not paid off yet around 8k with payments around 300-350 (extra put towards) that she alone has been paying.

My wife works as well. The reason why she doesn't contribute to the E-fund is she is paying her way through college right now, and the items would be like dining out less, less buying items, etc. We are in fact cutting those already so the focus doesn't need to be put here either.

FinancialPlanning,"Every spring, my company gives me a cash bonus of $25-30k USD. In the past few years, we haven’t had the option to change 401(k) contributions specifically for the bonus amount, so my standard contribution of 15% was taken off the top of my bonus and put straight into my 401(k). Then there was the income tax withholding on what was left, leaving me with “only” 60% of my cash bonus going as actual cash into my bank account. The tradeoff has been that my 401(k) is maxed out around September, leaving me with slightly higher paychecks the last few months of the year. 

This year, we have the option to set a different 401(k) contribution % to be applied to the bonus only - so I could change this to 0% and be left with my full bonus as cash after taxes. 

Question is, what should I do?

I don’t necessarily need the extra cash upfront. The potential bigger paychecks at the end of the year don’t really make a difference to me either. My spouse thinks I should leave the bonus deferral at 15% so that more cash gets invested sooner for more time to grow, etc. However I think it might be better to take the bonus as all cash now (after withholding), leaving my normal 401(k) contributions the same all year long for better dollar cost averaging.

FinancialPlanning,"26\[M\], $78k/yr, $1,888/monthly FHA at 2.65% 30/yr fixed.

Disclaimer, I came from being a homeless child to living in a shelter with my mom and then living in public housing. My mom sacrificed a lot to get here and these past couple years have been very hard on all of us. My mother played a huge gamble and put her life savings and emergency funds into buying a fixer upper in 2020. We took out loans, fixed it up and in 2022 we made a profit of $100k. This was the most we've ever had. 

It has been precisely one year since we bought our current house. It was bought as-is, the home was built on a slope so I had to fix up the basement flooding. It costed approx. $13k for our french drain and sump pump. We paid a couple lump-sum in the beginning and currently owe $7k. The 0% interest rate ends in August so I recently changed the monthly premium to $500/month and will pay a lump sum to finish off when the 0% offer is over. 

We then needed to mitigate the humidity issues so we installed HVAC downstairs. I opted for mini-split air conditioners for a total cost of $17k. I pay approx. $330/month at 0% which is for a total of 60 months. (upstairs has hvac but it was installed incorrectly. previous owner was a DIY guy and did a furnace and heat pump mismatch but I will correct it after my current hvac loan is paid off) 

I then paid $13k to finish the basement in cash so now I have $46k in my checking acct. Overall the house is finished. There still remains to be exterior repairs to be made such as the front porch concrete to be the correct grade and slope, fixing the driveway, perimeter edge garden bed to help with drainage and garage concrete is rekt so that needs to be finished, one of the last things I'd like to do is solar panels to get our electric bill to $0. 

Based on previous estimates and quotes. Driveway is like $2-6k depending on material. Sideyard garden bed for drainage is $2k. I don't know how much concrete for the porch would cost but I imagine roughly $5k and the garage renovation would be like $10k if I were to get concrete, insulation, and drywall. I would run out of money so I've decided to come to a halt and re-evaluate my finances. 

Note: I am not going to sell and downsize. I've been fortunate to land a 2.65% interest rate. Literally everyone has told me to not sell because that interest rate is rare in this economy. I just want advice how homeowners manage their finances and don't go broke.

FinancialPlanning,"Need some advice for 37/38 year old couple with 2 children (19 months, 1 month). Wife and I make around 250K combined a year. Both have company matching 401ks and pensions. At different points within the next 2.5 years, most of our larger loans (sans mortgage) will be fully paid off, providing a bunch of extra free cash flow for us (approx $2500/month). While we make a good salary, we never seem to feel all that great about our savings situation due to some of these loans. Neither of us got much, if any, assistance from our parents and frankly we just didn’t do a good enough job saving in our late 20s. Working on correcting that now and setting up our kids for a better future. 

Here are three things we are trying to plan for:

1. College expenses for both kids. Plan to open 529 and contribute 250 per kid per month in to it. With 6% return, should amount to about $100k per child once they’re ready for college. 

2. We’d like have the ability to help both kids with one, some or all of the following: wedding expenses (Hindu wedding), a car, down payment on house. This is where I struggle. Do I setup individual savings accounts in their name and contribute towards it each month, earning practically nothing on the money? Do I create an investment account under parents names and draw from it when needed? If so, what type to avoid the most taxes/penalties? Do I forego a savings account and contribute more to 529 knowing I can convert some to Roth IRA, or I believe I can withdraw my 529 contributions without penalty? 

3. Estate/money to pass down when we are no longer alive. We have term life insurance policies through work, but nothing outside of that. Do we start to look in to this? We aren’t maxing out our 401k contributions, mostly because we are hindered by the loans that will all be gone in next 2.5 years. 

We’ve been working on correcting some bad habits (ie ordering out a lot) and I already am starting to feel better about money management.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello, 

I will just get straight to it over the last year I have managed to accrue over 18k in debt on my credit cards. I have over 10k on one card a little over 8k on another and around 500 on the last card. I came up with a plan myself but would like to get some second opinions. Before I get to the plan I’ll fill you guys in a little on my income. I have two jobs and being in 1,350 between the both of them every two weeks. I have budgeted out between 500-600 for payments on my cards every month. (Depending on the paychecks) so I’ll just say 500 to keep it simple. Two of my credit cards have 0 interest until July and the other (8k) card has 19% interest. 

My Plan:
So my plan was to take a loan out of my 401k of 14,500. So I could pay off the bulk of my debt without interest, and pay off about half of my card with the 19% interest. In doing this if I kept my budget of 500 I was gonna keep paying on my cards anyway I would pay off my last card in bout a year. Then I could actually start putting that 500 into savings to put back into my 401k immediately. I would also still be good on my finances as well after doing this. I know I would be a couple years behind on my 401 but I can make up for that in the future by investing more into it as well. 

As a last note I also may be able to get a 0 interest loan through my job for a high amount possible 10 and they would take out the payments directly from my paycheck as well however they would probably be higher. That is still an unknown factor at the moment though. I was just wondering if I could get some second opinions on my plan. 

I thank you all for taking a minute to read and hopefully I can navigate through the murky waters I got myself into.

FinancialPlanning,"My dad passed away recently and it came to light that he named me as one of the beneficiaries on his life insurance policy. 

My mom says that it was a mistake and that I am not supposed to be a beneficiary, just my mom. She wants me to file for the money and sign the check over to her. 

I’m going to go through with it, because she is my mom and blah blah whatever. 

But the insulting part is that my mom says I can keep $5000 from it to throw my wedding. I only have $2000 from my own money cause my partner and I are kinda broke. 

I’m not sure if I should sign this money over via check or not. How do I best manage this money so that I can help take care of my mom and also other family matters like my sisters student loans and my partners and my wedding? It might make my mom mad but I want to manage this smart.

FinancialPlanning,"land investment advice

I bought 10 acres of walkable and build able land in WV in 21 with the hopes of moving out there sometime this year. Things have changed a bit and my employment seems to not care about my request to transfer work locations despite having a location close to the land. That being said the land has been sitting there and I want to do with my money. I payed it off almost a year ago and if I was to switch locations up there I would want a bigger parcel anyway. With all that said the son in law of the original owners inherited the other half of my parcel and has expressed interest in purchasing my portion and already moved in to his parcel. On top of this love 8 hours round trip from my parcel and have started thinking that I can sell it for like 20-30% profit (I bought it for 75k) and put it into my current mortgage and pay it off quickly or put it into a duplex and turn it into a rental. I spoke with the realtor who helped me purchase the land and he was encouraging me to invest into the property and turn it into an Airbnb / VRBO etc but I don't really have any connections there and don't have much more time.

FinancialPlanning,"I have a property in a high cost-of-living area.  I live in it and also rent out part of it.  The rental income covers most of my costs for the property.

Since it is my personal residence, I deduct about half of the mortgage interest on my 1040, whereas the other half is a Schedule E expense against the rental income.  I also get a homeowner exemption on property taxes.

I am considering putting the property in a trust for estate planning.  I believe an LLC is out of the question because of the homeowner tax breaks, is that correct?

Anyway, suppose this property is in my own living trust and I get married in a few years.  I've heard that revocable trusts are pass-through for taxation purposes.  If I were to sell the property and was married filing jointly, would I get a capital gains exclusion of 250k (individual), 500k (MFJ), or something more complicated due to the partial use as a rental property?

Also the rule that whatever I decide, I can't use it for another purpose. This money whether invested or payed down is for the loan at the end of modified loan term. I just want a sanity check here.

Private Loan: $76k @ 3.46%

My plan: Invest whatever money I planned to throw at the loan into a brokerage fidelity index fund. Whatever money I invest monthly, I can put into my loan amortization table to resemble what my loan would look like at the end...That is - Once the loan is zero (based on had I payed down the debt), I cross reference my brokerage to see where I'm at. 

Specifically, my brokerage at a whole should equal (remaining loan balance + $ interest saved had I payed off the loan taken from amortization table - capital gains). 

As a side note, I believe the risk here is relatively small.

FinancialPlanning,"I work remotely so this would be 100% a luxury.

I make $110/year. I drive an 8-year-old car that works fine with no major issues i just need to buy 4 new tires which is where my decision is coming from. Why buy them if i get a new car?

I invest, I save etc.

The car I want is expensive esp for someone that works from home. Its a 63k car. Its been my dream car for many years.

I have zero debt right now because all i ever do is save, not spend, and invest and never spend money on myself.

I have a few vacations coming up and although i can financially swing this all, the frugalness inside me is struggling with this impractical decision to get the car I want.

I planned on getting a new car (my dream car) once this car kicks it. But i drive a toyota and its just in perfect condition and seems like it will never die (i know thats a good thing) but just more that i can't seem to justify the expense when i have a great situation.

Its very freeing to be debt-free and ive made sacrifices including never going out with friends or vacationing until i was 30. Now i just feel like i want something silly just because.

A fancy car wont really get me from one place to another any different than my current car.

Ive thought about how my trade in value will be worth more now than later, and with the trade in it means less in sales tax for this car.

Im not sure if there will ever be the perfect time to get a new car. Its a bad time, higher interest rates, low inventory, but who is to say it wont stay this way? I doubt that parts will get cheaper. I could go for a cheaper new car, sure.

FinancialPlanning,"I apologize if this is long but I’m just starting into investing and really want to make sure I’m going about this the right way. I’ve tried reading up as much as I can on all of this and this is where I’m at. 

I’m 25 and just started my first post grad job and I’m making $120k a year base with potentially a little more if I pick up hours. I have plenty of federal students loans and one private loan (~$8k) that I’m thinking about just paying all off right now because of the higher interest rate. 

I’m planning on maxing out my employee 401k and I think after 1 year will get employer match. It also gives an option for Roth 401k. Should I contribute to both? Or just the traditional 401k. I tried reading the wiki on this and doing research but I’m still a bit confused because I haven’t had any guidance on any of this and I’m all self (and Reddit) taught. I understand the difference between pre tax and post tax money, but I’m not sure how I should split it if at all. 

I just opened up a Roth IRA through Fidelity and put in the 2022 max of $6k and will max 2023 out as well. I invested $4500 in FSKAX and I’m thinking I’ll invest in the FXAIX international fund (somewhere said do 70/30 US/international). Is this a smart move? Are these two funds reasonable investments? Is now a good time to buy as I’ve heard stuff about a future stock market crash or something of that sort. 

I have about $50k sitting in the bank and I’m thinking about opening a HYSA and putting some into there as an emergency fund as my bills right now are minimal. 

Even if it’s just to one or two pieces I’d this post, any and all advice and feedback is majorly appreciated as I’m admittedly very uneducated and new to this.

FinancialPlanning,"I (21m) have been gifted around $2200 from a family member. I plan on keeping some of it to put into my savings but will put $1500 into some kind of account that can have me earn interest over time. I don't expect it to balloon to like millions of dollars but I do want it to have a bit more than what I started with.

I've come up with a few options (a few of which I'm open to trying multiple of)

1. Put it in a savings account with Capital one, CITbank or PNC. PNC is my primary bank so I'm more open to it. I just seen that the APY is high with these guys.
2. put a small portion ($100-200) in some safe stocks. I'm not really a stocks guy so I'd just put it in like apple or something. 
3. Keep it where it is now: Janus Henderson. I need to do some more research on this.

I just want this money to stay safe and grow a bit overtime. I'm just a college student with a retail job, I would probably use this money for like an apartment one day. This isn't the start to my retirement fund or anything.

The monthly cash flow is great even after expenses and repairs, which leaves me thinking it would be wise to cash out refinance one or all three of the properties regardless of the high interest rates. I would use this the cash out to buy another rental either all cash or with 25-30% down. In the future, refinance back to 3-4% rates.

Now I been wanting to buy a house for a while as of right now I have a bit of capital but ideally if I were to get a property I would look somewhere around 75k - 150k somewhere a long those lines. My goal would be minimum 20% down to avoid PMI. I would perfer my house mortgage to be no more 1000$ if not somewhere very close to those lines.

I make 24$ hourly should be getting a raise soon as well but, my gross is 3840$ a month.

(Keep in mind 6% is also taken away from my check weekly towards 401k and that’s what I keep weekly) ^

Currently I pay

Should I focus on paying of my truck first which would be the smart thing to do of course the Ramsey way.

I know there’s good debt and bad debt I wanna be able to get into real estate as soon as I’m able too but I’m a manageable way but I also don’t wanna be the guy that’s to afraid to get into any debt and makes sure to pay everything off and be 30 getting my first home I hope that makes sense what would you guys do any advice?

FinancialPlanning,"Hoping someone can provide some good advice.....

I'm a married guy with two kids in my early thirties. I received a work promotion which required me to move with my family to a foreign country for a couple of years. I currently earn a much better income and my plan is to save this money and invest in different financial markets.  My wife on the other hand is currently a stay at home mum as she cannot work in the country I've been relocated to, which is fine. My only issue is that my wife has no real desire to save money as aggressively as I would like to. She says that she's on board but I know she isn't thrilled about my plans and would rather use this money to live comfortably and travel whilst we're overseas.  I'm unsure if this is a common problem that married men face. I'm slightly unsure how to handle it. I'm willing to sacrifice and work hard for a much brighter future, whilst my wife just wants comfort and very little sacrifice. I can understand her perspective, but also cant relate especially given the opportunity we have to become significantly better off financially.",t2_tlpx4hhi,0,My financial goals are completely different to my wife's.........,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,10pvayj,True,JB_anonymousX,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10pvayj/my_financial_goals_are_completely_different_to_my/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10pvayj/my_financial_goals_are_completely_different_to_my/,523618,1675159378,0,,False,1675159390,1675159390,2023-01-31 10:02:58,,,,,,
FinancialPlanning,"My wife and I are moving to Sacramento from Pensacola, both been working as RNs for 2 years now and have enough saved for a down payment and little extra on houses in the area for where planning on living in. We both have jobs waiting for us as well. We’re not so much worried about timing the market as much as if it would be a smart move financially to buy a house in the area rather than renting a house for a year if we aren’t sure if we’re going to be there for more than a couple years. I can’t tell you how many people have told me I’m throwing money away renting vs buying.

I'm looking to max out my 401k plan and take advantage of my employer's 401k match (dollar for dollar, first 4%), however, I don't want to max it out too early and miss out on any employer matching contributions. Income is Base + Commission and can vary by $30k-$50k based on my sales performance. 

**Example Income:** $100,000 Annually

**Example Match:** dollar for dollar, first 4%

**Scenario 1:** $100,000 contributing across each paycheck consistently will equal matching contributions of $4,000 annually. ($22,500 myself + $4,000 match = $26,500 total)

**Scenario 2:** $100,000 total income and maxes out contributions 6-months in will only receive $2,000 in matched funds. ($22,500 from myself + $2,000 match = $24,500 total)

Because I have a variable income, I can't simply divide the annual maximum of $22,500 out over 26 equal paychecks. 

Looking for recommendations on how to adjust my contributions to make sure I can receive the full matching % from my company.

FinancialPlanning,"Looking through guidelines of how to spend your income (assuming all debts are paid), it's usually 401k match, emergency fund, maximize HSA, maximize roth IRA and then if anything's left over maximize 401k and then put anything over and above into a taxable account. The problem is for most people this isn't realistic if they aren't making 6 figures. Most people cannot afford this, and so it leaves open the question of whether they can enjoy any of their money at present.

In my current situation, I am single, I make around 75k in a pretty affordable city, I bought a house few years ago, made a 20% down payment and I can live within my means. I have saved up a sizeable emergency fund, and with contributing the match (6% contribution, with 10% match for a total of 16%), maxing HSA ($237.5 per month this year) and maxing out my roth ($541.66 per month this year), I end up with around $400-$500 left every month. This is a reasonable amount, but I'm not accounting for any vacation spending in here. If I travel once a year with my family (they live overseas), it costs me around $5k with hotels, flights and other spending, so if I want to leave my emergency fund intact and not touch any of the retirement accounts, I am cutting it very close. These prices also go up with inflation.

I was thinking about this within the context of a trade-off between maximizing my roth IRA and putting money into a taxable investment account with a moderate risk investment strategy. While it is true that you lose tax benefits when you invest in a normal taxable investment account, you can also have access to earnings quicker without having to pay fines and enjoy some of that money now. At some point it feels like investing in a roth IRA has benefits, but if I don't live that long, I will have potentially foregone money I should have used to get more out of my current life than accumulating it for a future I may not have.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello friends,

I recently graduated from a 4 year state-school with a degree in Comp Sci and minor in Math. I have interned with a private company (medical industry) for the past 2 years, and will be joining their early career rotational program. I am starting on an infrastructure team, but would like to eventually do a rotation with the ML/AI team because that was my true passion in school. My starting salary is $83,000 plus an $8,500 sign on bonus and a 4% yearly incentive bonus. I have a 6% matching 401k since i started as an intern with the company. 

Coming from my background, I am very grateful for the amount I will be making,  however I do have a sizable amount of student loans I have to pay off. If I put in 3 years at aforementioned company, they’ll pay for me to get my mba, which I plan to do to eventually work my way into a management position. 

My question is for anyone who has experience navigating making decent money out of the gate coming from a less fortunate background:
Other than improving my technical skills and providing good work during these next 3 years while I wait to get my mba, what else can I do to improve my financial situation/ future prospects? Are there any steps you took that worked well for you in your early career to improve your financial situation and career outlook, or steps you wish you didn’t take? 

I know this is a very subjective topic, but I come from a family and background where this amount of money out of college is unheard of, so just hearing what others did in a scenario like this would help because I don’t really have anyone to talk about it with irl.

FinancialPlanning,"Financial planning is a way to manage your money so that you can reach your long-term financial goals. Take charge of your money and make sure you're on the right path to financial stability and independence.

Here are some tips to get you started on your path to financial planning:
1. Figure out your current financial situation by taking stock of your income, expenses, debts, and assets.
Set realistic financial goals. Think about what you want to do with your money, like save for retirement, buy a home, or pay off debt.
3. Make a budget. A budget helps you keep track of what you spend and makes sure you don't spend more than you can afford.
4. Put money into yourself by going to school, getting training, or learning new skills. This will help you make more money and secure your financial future.
Diversify your investments. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, invest in different types of assets to lower your risk.
6. Look at your plan often and make changes as needed. Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it's important to look at your plan often and make changes as needed.
Remember that planning for your money is a journey that lasts your whole life, and it's never too early or too late to start. Take charge of your money today and set yourself up for a bright financial future.

FinancialPlanning,"TL;DR on the fence about spending $30k to payoff my car vs continue paying the minimum in a looming layoff environment.

I'm at one of the big firms that have recently laid off 10k+ workers. I'm relieved that I wasn't impacted but the anxiety is real among those of us who are left. This led me to rethink my financial situation for the year. 

I like to think that I'm relatively financially responsible doing ~40% monthly savings rate. My breakdown is:

84% investments (mostly index ETFs), 401k, including kids 529
16% cash and HYSA with a 15 month expenses runway
Maxing 401k
Maxing Roth IRA

In light of the recent layoffs, my biggest insecurities are now my two big ticket recurring expenses. They're my mortgage and auto loan. Both are low interest with my mortgage at 2.71% and my car at 3.41%.

I follow this thread a lot and agree on taking advantage of my low interest and paying the minimum. But another part of me also imagines the relief of paying off the car as this could free up my 2nd largest monthly expense ($30k left in the loan). I keep going back and forth on paying it outright for peace of mind. In contrast if I just keep paying the minimum, I would be paying ~$9k this year (it's a used EV that we plan of using for the next decade+).

So I'm on the fence of pouring the extra $21k to pay off my car and not worry about car payments anymore or sticking with the min payments that I'd have to continue paying even if I'm out of a job in the near future because who knows what will happen. I'd be using about 5 months worth of my savings leaving me with 10 month runway in savings.

I'm also aware of the opportunity cost but I'm most likely going to be conservative this year and keeping most of my current/future earnings in my HYSA (so you could say it will continue to grow no matter which direction I go).",t2_111cpg1k,0,Survived the early tech layoffs but still prepping for the worst,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,10p6b31,True,totality888,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10p6b31/survived_the_early_tech_layoffs_but_still/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10p6b31/survived_the_early_tech_layoffs_but_still/,523011,1675094253,0,,False,1675094265,1675094266,2023-01-30 15:57:33,,,,,,

I have a 401 K through  work which I contribute to regularly and will currently increase my contributions.  
I also have a 1,600 mortgage in a HCOL city plus a decent nest-egg/o-shit fund (I won't specify the amount, other than it would get me by for 8 months if I stayed in the city if something happened with my job and 2 years if I moved back home  LCOL country to wait out any financial storm).

My monthly expenses are pretty minimal since I cook at home a lot, don't have a car, have no student loan payments and no real credit card debt.

I've always wanted to invest or at least figure out how to grow my nest egg but the process seems so nebulous.  I tried figuring out Robinhood but it seemed so informal and geared to a specific type of investor. I don't really have time to track the ups and downs of stocks, so I'd love to find something a little less intensive.  What websites/brokerage firms would you recommend?

FinancialPlanning,My daughter is a graduate student (working on a PhD) so she will have a very low income for the next few years. I think she makes less than $25K but I am not exactly sure of the amount of her stipend. Her bank account is left over from her childhood and I am on the account. I don’t look at the transactions but when I login to my accounts I can see that her account balance is growing. It is up close to $15K now. She started grad school 1.5 years ago w/ about 10K she had earned from a summer internship. Last year I convinced her to put 2K in a Roth. Now I am thinking she should put more in a Roth but I don’t know how much she should keep in savings. I am also thinking that maybe she should put X dollars per month in a Roth? Is that even possible? Please give me advice so that I can share it with her. She definitely won’t investigate financial planning options herself but she will listen to my advice.

FinancialPlanning,"Hey guys I’m 21yr about to graduate from college. I have a job with a starting salary of $110k + $10k signing bonus + up to 19% (20.9k) performance bonus per year ready when graduate. 

I currently have a Roth IRA with M1Finance with about $8k and a JP Morgan Wealth Management account with about $50k. 

I’m trying to learn and understand how my current and future funds should be allocated. I’ve been doing research and crunching numbers. I’m seeing that my percentage gains/loses for my Roth are similar or a little better than my JPM Wealth Management accounts. I feel like I should take the money out of JPM (since I also pay an advisory fee) and use that to get some Vanguard Index Funds. 

Additionally I recently started saving money for investing in real estate, so I’d like to use a bit of that $50k to put aside for some real estate savings as a starting point. 

I know that my Index funds would have majority of my funds so I feel like I should have them in a Roth IRA for tax benefits. But I also know that I’m really close to the income threshold of not being able to use my Roth anymore. 

I’m also assuming my job will give me a 401K, which would now give me like 3 different retirement accounts which seems like overkill. And I’m confused as to where 401k’s are held. Like, if I open a vanguard account for my index funds, can I tell my job that I want my 401k to be only vanguard index funds?

Current Funds:
- Job: $110k + $10k signing + up to 19% bonus
- M1Finance Roth IRA: $8k
- JP Morgan Wealth Management: $50k
- Real Estate Savings: $4k
- Emergency Savings: $1k
- Some More in Checking Accounts

Desired Fund Accounts:
- Vanguard Index Funds (Roth and/or Individual)

Goal:
- Get rid of JP Morgan wealth management to invest in index funds. I’d prefer not to have so many retirement accounts because it seems pointless.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello,

I am looking to buy a new Porsche Taycan. The total price of the car is about 125k after title and registration and all the features I want. I am 16 years old and this will be my first car. I use to run a shoe wholesale company where I would sell in bulk quantities to stores but recently left that business since it wasn't as profitable as it use to be. I do amazon FBA using OA and wholesale methods. Right now that is doing about 80-90k in retune and about 20k on a bad month and 40k on a really good month. I am looking to finance this car and hopefully write it off if I am able to through my company.

My terms are 25k down at 3.2% APR (Hopefully) and a monthly payment of about 2,300 per month. My parents have a 740 credit score . that isn't even including insurance which I am sure will be about $800 per month since i'm a 16 year old guy  bringing my monthly total to $3100 per month.

24, single in a MCOL city. I make $96,000 per year salary + 10% bonus. 

I spend ~$3,600 per month which includes all of my bills, discretionary spending, rent, and a car payment. 

I have $12k remaining on a 2.4% car loan with payments at about $280/mo. It was a 60 mo loan because it was the same low rate no matter the number of months. I also have $23k in federal student loans in forbearance. 

$15k saved in a HYSA for emergencies. I am making out a pre-tax 401k ($22.5k), Roth ($6.5k), HSA ($3,850), and will begin contributing about $5k per year to a taxable account with bonuses and excess cash flow. 

Account values: 
- HSA is $7100
- Roth is $17,300
- 401k is 17,300
- Taxable is $3,100

I had 100k in options and was given the choice of cashing them out or exercising the options and transferring them to the new company. I choose the latter and filed an 83b with the IRS.  I was told by my former company that I would need to pay the IRS something like 30k for exercising them, and that it would save me money in the long run once these new shares matured in 4 years (supposedly to 700k).  I got my W2 and see that they added the 100k to my regular wages - I was under the assumption that this would be some kind of separate deal, like a 1099 or something.

We are paying about 2,600 a month (I pay half) on the mortgage and my individual car payment is 415, our insurance is about 250 for the cars that I pay for.

As you can see by my budget breakdown right now with costs im about breaking even and our finances are separate until we get married (4mo’s she makes significantly more than I do).

I know that they will let me take out money from my 401k for a first time home purchase penalty free, but I don’t know if it’s worth it. My salary is set to go up about 5% soon, and I’m getting a roughly 3k bonus in March plus whatever we get back from the wedding and combines assets.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all
I’m 35/m in Texas. I started my own company about 2 years ago, and am doing pretty good.  In 2021 year my business made about 400k, and my net is about 300k. In 2022 I made about 270k and net is about 170k. I do not see my business dying out anytime soon, as I work in the restoration, natural disaster segment in a really good location with plenty of natural disasters. My income could even reach the 7 figure mark someday. It’s fairly common in this industry to see big swings. 

My issue is that I don’t have anything saved for retirement. Before I started my company I was only making 50k a year in a soul sucking office job. I wasn’t saving for retirement then either. 

I was told that I make too much to invest into a Roth IRA, and since I’m self employed I don’t have access to a 401k.  How do I save for retirement? Do I just open a brokerage??  I have quite a bit of cash sitting in my account. I was thinking about just opening a brokerage account and investing 50k right away into ETFs. Is this a bad idea? Also, should I dollar cost average? Or just invest a lump sum? What tax implications would this have on me and my business?

Please be my role models. Please drop some beautiful financial wisdom on me!! And also, please be kind. 

————-————-————-————-————-

I’m on the verge of a life change (new state/house/lifestyle) and I need some guidance so as not to completely blow it.

Here’s the scoop:
I’m the “breadwinner” for a family of three (+5 cats + a dog).

I make 140k/year (salary) + an additional $23k/year (VA disability payments).

I tried to figure out the 50/30/20 rule, but mine looks more like 80/30/0. Which is problematic not only because I’m *not* saving, but also because 80% + 30% = 110%, and (surprise!) the extra 10% is coming from credit cards. 

Despite our obviously not-good credit card situation, we are technically spending the prescribed amount (30%). Which to me indicates that our spending isn’t really out of control? Rather, it seems I need to focus on getting the 80% (“needs”) down to 50% where it belongs. (That’s my thinking, anyway?)

So what does my 80% “needs” look like?
-2 new cars (25k purchase + 35k lease) = 410/month + 495/month
[We had ancient cars that both died within a few months of each other, hence 2 new cars]
-Student loans (Originally 200k, but now only 11k left to pay!)
-Budget $1200/month for groceries.
-Budget $600/month for pet food. They eat… so much.
-Utilities (power, gas, water, trash) + internet is around 500-700/month, depending on the season
-Credit card 1 = 15k @ 18% = $300/month
-Credit card 2 = 25k @ 14% = $515/month
-Personal loan 1 = 25k @ 0% (will be paid in full in a few months)
-Personal loan 2 = 6k @ 16% = $680/month (will be paid in full in a few months)
-Car insurance = $112/month
-Pre-school = $170/month
-Phones = $175/month
-Mortgage = $2k/month, for now

I’m probably missing a few things, because ultimately it adds up to over $7k in monthly payments (out of my $9056 monthly pay). It needs go be closer to $4.5k/9k…

We currently live in the middle of nowhere on some acreage in the woods. But, PLOT TWIST, we’re moving to another state (non-negotiable) where we’ll be living in the city (we’re city people at heart, so this isn’t as crazy as it sounds).

Here’s the scoop on that:
-Current mortgage is 380k @ 2.75%, which comes out to $2k/month including insurance/taxes
-New mortgage will be 340k @ 6.25% (eesh) or $2.8k/month including insurance/taxes (I plan to refinance if ever rates are good again)

Because of the difference in taxes and utilities, and because we’ll be paying down some debt, the amount we owe monthly won’t actually change much after we move, despite the steep mortgage increase.

We will make ~$100k profit when our house sells. This sounds huge, but it’s essentially already spoken for (broker’s fees, closing costs, *30k of personal loans*, *15k of credit card debt*, new house improvements, and my daughter’s education).

SO:
-What do I change to fix things so that I’m not stuck at 80/30/0 forever? I really feel like the money is there - I’m just not doing it right??
-How do I actually SAVE money? (I do have a 401k, but I don’t have emergency savings)
-Should I sell my (beloved) car (mine is the cheaper one, and it’s also a much better city car, but the other car is on lease for another 2 years).
Background: My husband is a stay-at-home dad and I work (mostly) from home, but need to drive into the office (1.5 hours away) a few times a month (never scheduled, sort of “on call.”)
Even though neither of us needs to drive often, when we do, it’s usually at the same time. Also, my husband doesn’t like to be left without a car at home in case there’s an emergency of some sort. But I think this might change when we live in the city.

-Does anything stand out to you as “HOLY COW SHE’S SPENDING WAY TOO MUCH ON THAT?” (and do you have any suggestions for fixing it?)
-What things am I not considering that I should be?

FinancialPlanning,"I had a random thought earlier today, and figured I'd look into it a bit. This is just hypothetical, so I don't actually have any real numbers here (so I'll make some up)...

* Let's say I have a friend who has $5,000 of credit card debt at 20%
   * they have a steady job and they've been paying off the debt consistently 
* Of the money I keep in my Check/Savings/HYSA, I could afford to part with $5,000
   * I'd like to see it back, but I don't *need* to
   * I'd otherwise just leave it in an HYSA at \~4% interest

What reasons would either of us have for not wanting to give a friendly loan at 5% (for example)?

* My friend would be able to pay off CC debt immediately
* My friend would now owe me, but at a much easier to manage rate
* I would be making 1% more than if I didn't do this

**It seems like a win-win**

.

Now, I always see, ""don't loan your friends money"", as then the friendship can feel like a business at times. I also understand that you should never lend anything that you aren't prepared to lose.

Debt just puts you so far behind. Doing this ""friendly loan"" seems like a very low risk for me, with a very large gain for them - and hopefully a slight win for me.

* Worst case, they don't pay me back and it messed up our friendship
   * I wouldn't do this if I didn't trust them enough, and if they betray that, then that's on them
* Best case, they're in a much better spot and I'm in a slightly better spot

.

**So the question is...**

* What reasons would you see for **me** not wanting to do this?
* What reasons would you see for **my friend** not wanting to do this?

It just seems like a win-win with the only risk being how confident I am that they'll be able to keep their end of the bargain. Am I missing something here?

Plus I just moved out so now I’m paying $1,800 a month for my apartment. These combined with my other expenses (food, subscriptions, wifi, etc.) leave me with below $700 a month for saving/investing. Not to mention I have to buy furniture so funds are super tight right now.

Of course the logical thing to do is sell my car but I use it on a daily basis (nothing too serious, just for convenience) and would have to go without a car for months while I save up for a cheaper one.

I watch a lot of Graham Stephan on YouTube and stuff and he usually says try to save 50% of your income, so being able to save less than 15% feels terrible.

Is $700 a month even enough for saving? Especially considering all my expenses. Should i sell the car or just keep paying the insurance and see if it gets cheaper after the 5 months are up?

FinancialPlanning,"Hello everyone, looking for some input here. I bought my house in 2020 with an almost record low 3% interest rate on a 225k loan. Since then property value has increased quite a bit and my property is worth an estimated 337k according to some paperwork provided by my new mortgage processor.
Long story short, since purchasing the home we have had our first child and went from a 2 income household down to just mine. I make right at $100k/yr largely paid out via quarterly and end of year bonuses. I have approx 10k in credit card debt, I owe about 20k on my car and about another 20k on my wife’s car and she has about 10k in cc debt as well, that’s about it for total debt.  I am considering tapping into my home equity via a HELOC to consolidate the debts and reduce the strain of the monthly payments and get back to a position of paying cash for everything. 1400 mortgage, 1200 for both cars, plus cc payments.

FinancialPlanning,"Husband 31 and I 30 have had our gorgeous baby boy July of last year but it knocked us quite badly financially.


Baby was a wanted surprise but I would have wanted to wait a few more years to get a larger nest egg under us prior to giving birth.
We both live in a foreign country so have no family to assist and were under the impression we wouldn’t get gov help with parental leave so saved up 7K for baby stuff and doctors etc (thankfully I ended up getting the leave but the majority of it went towards rent).
I think we probably would be a bit better off if we hadn’t of booked a trip back to his home country at the beginning of last year to see his family (post covid)….a lot of money went towards paying for bills while we are away, spending money etc


We aren’t poor but we are poor if you understand lol, me being out of work for 7 months has hit us hard and we went through that 7K a bit too fast for my liking. We have zero savings now and only some investment money which I am really depressed about touching but most likely will have to…


I start back at work in March as PT (3 days a week for now) and partner is working full time.
Together we earn 52k and 58k at our jobs, we have no debt and are generally very good at saving (I always aim to save 30-40% of my pay).
We have minimal subscriptions (only Spotify and Netflix) and pay for car insurance and partners health insurance (I will need to get insurance this year also).
We are moving rentals in June this year so will be saving up for the move and a little nest egg to ensure we are covered for everything but I really want to get my Emergency Fund back (usually have around 12K in my account but last year this just got depleted so badly….)

Would it be in our best interest to sell all the stocks outright and use them for purchase of the house, or spread out the sale of the stocks to avoid too many capital gains taxes.

I might have to pay 200-500 out of pocket for mortgage but thats fine since I’m building equity, about 1500-2000 would probably be my expenses when i have a mortgage but that would still leave me about 2,000 left to keep investing in stocks , my question is , am i setting myself up for failure by not going to school for something serious?

FinancialPlanning,"SO I'm a 17yr old high-schooler from the US. I am planning on going to college in the fall and I finally got my first (secure) job at a local business. I get paid \~11/hr and I can only work 10-12hrs /week, so I make \~$110 a week. I also have quite a bit of money saved up from just gifts and all that, and also from online studies/research studies that I do for extra cash. 

I know that isn't a lot, but I also can't sacrifice much time because of schoolwork. Besides, I don't have to worry about food/bills (I love with my parents and don't eat by myself at all), gas (I am in-charge of taking my siblings to sports/school/other stuff so my parents cover for gas), and my options for college next year are at two schools where I can go for either full tuition or a full-ride (so my parents would be able to use my college fund on at most my housing/food/books/etc;). I also am good on a car bc (so long as nothing bad happens) I have a vehicle that should last me well after I have an actual job. 

I also have a debit card (so savings and checking accounts) w/ money on it but the only things I really ever use if for are toiletries or to run to the store or other errands for my parents. And they usually compensate on what I bought for them. 

So my question is: what should I do with this money? I want to save it and be smart, but I don't rlly know what to do with it? Should I just put it in my savings account? I am honestly just confused lol. I've never had money like this before and I don't want all the money I will have to just sit around (when it could be compounding or something).

FinancialPlanning,"Okay so long story short I grew up working class (baby of 7) with my mom being a big spender and my dad being financially literate. My dad taught me nothing and my moms spending habits kind of rubbed off on me (to an extent). Anywho, I’m 34 now and have taken notice to my poor financial management habits the last few years. This past July I was laid off from my job (received severance) and it took a few months to find work. I did pay all of my major bills ahead and cut off anything frivolous for the time being. Unfortunately because I didn’t have a savings, financially I struggled which was my wake up call to grow up and get it together. Right now I make $93k + $700 a month in child support. I am a single parent and live in a place where COL is fairly feasible. My cousin is helping me right now both with learning how to be financially responsible and my credit. Last few months I’ve been diligent and built up a solid savings, all bills + extra curricular activities paid and plenty of play money left over bi weekly which gets pushed into emergency funds when not used. My DTI is near nothing (one CC one car payment and I rent)

My son graduates HS in 2025. My goal is to buy a condo or townhouse here before then, add his name to the deed when he’s 18 and keep it as passive income/an option for him when he graduates college. He wants to go to school back home in CA to be near family so I want to ensure I can set him up there plus provide him a nice/good reliable car. Once I know he’s set for school I’d like to travel (my job is remote). 

My question is…Is this doable or a long shot? I have a habit of sometimes being unrealistic and I just want to be sure the route I’m going is the proper way.

I am at a bit of a crossroads in making a decision, and my wife and I would love some advice.

We owe $140k on it still, and there is about $35k worth of equity. (we bought the property on discount from a friend.) We pay $900/mo right now. We make $95k/year net.   


We love our land. it is 1.5 acres of forested land, and it is in a desirable location. For all that good though, the home is only about 900sqft, and it is dated; being build in 1940.  We are wanting to build a 1500sqft home. I am trying to bid out the costs of building a home right now, but am estimating $200k. We can purchase a less desirable lot of 0.37acres in a neighboring town for $49k right now.   


Our hopeful end mortgage is \~$260k. We both want to understand what it would take to stay on this land though, and delay building, but don't really know how long we would have to wait, what we should be doing now, or other details. We can afford about double our monthly mortgage right now, roughly $1800. A

FinancialPlanning,"Hi everyone!

I have a hypothetical scenario I would like to run by you in the hope that you could give me insight into what this will do to my credit score.

My credit score is currently 908/999. The average age of credit accounts is 29 months.

I have been toying with the idea of applying for a Barclays credit card - not because I need more credit, but because I (1) have heard they are more likely to give mortgages to non-UK citizens when the time comes to purchase a home, and (2)  you can earn Avios points with the credit card. 

I also need a new phone. Mine is just broken at this point, and I begrudgingly have been looking at contracts to buy a new phone from the mobile network I am currently signed up to (pay as you go - no credit line currently). 

What will happen if I pursue both of these options? I know it will negatively impact my score as it is two new lines of credit, but is it better to pursue both and take one big knock or stagger them? 

I know the UK assesses the average age of credit accounts. My current logic says I should get both at the same time and rebuild to salvage as much as I can in terms of time. But are there other risks I may be missing? Please flag them if you can think of anything.

FinancialPlanning,"Hey guys, I am hoping to get some general guidance here before I seriously consider pursuing a new vehicle. I also want to headline by saying that I am an advisor by profession and have learned that more eyes are better than my own. Now some numbers:

I have an income range of $99-$125k depending on VC. I currently save 22% of all income to a retirement + $1000 a year in an HSA. I also am able to save and invest about $10000+ a year in cash/brokerage pretty easily at my worst income years. I currently am 26 with just over $10k in money market/stocks at about a 50/50 split. I don’t have a lot to show for yet although I expect to triple my savings this year and I also feel on target for my age for retirement (26 with about $40k saved in 401k invested properly)

For expenses it is currently $1000 for rent, and $600 all in for my utilities (phone, internet, TV, Car insurance, Health, gas, electric, etc). Food can range for me but typically falls between $100-$200 a week. Outside of that I am at a net profit every month of around $4000. I have just started making this income so I expect to grow assets very well and also be able to absorb expenses very well. 

Only debt I have is $24k of federal student loans (maybe $10k is forgiven but I’m not holding my breath). My company also pays down some of the loans (their payment is more than my minimum). 

Now here’s the fun part. The car dealer I have service my car sent me a letter saying they will give me a $12k trade in offer + $1000 from the dealer as a down payment on a 2.9% APR 60 month loan. My car is good but getting a little older and will need some work this year. For the car people I have a 2015 Honda Accord LX with 100.5k miles on it. It will need $2000 of work this year as well. The dealer has a 2023 Civic Sport brand new for $25.5k. It would serve me well for an easy 8-10 years considering my experience with my accord. I figure if I can but $2.5k down + my trade in + their $1k down I might be able to finance $10k at the 2.9% and then work to pay it down. 

Thoughts? I think it’s too good to be true but if I can’t get the Civic for $10k financed then I’m out imo. I value saving in my 20s but I feel this could be a decent side step to get a newer car that I can keep and maintain well.

Hello! 
My parents are both elderly, my mom is in good health however my dad has many health problems and has had many strokes that affect his cognitive ability. Pre-strokes he had a great career where he earned a good amount of money, however he spent it as quick as it came in. My mother has some money and has been very wise with it. Our worry is that, if she passes before him, he will blow through the money in a matter of months (maybe a year). In our province (Manitoba, Canada) it is law that she leaves half of her estate to him. But is there some kind of trust or something we can put it in where he can only access some of it at a time?  He was not a great father so none of us children want to be saddled with supporting him if he does blow through it all. 
Any ideas or suggestions would help.

FinancialPlanning,"Was hoping to get insight on whether I should aim to rent / own my first place out of college. Here's some details on my current living situation:

Location: Tampa, FL

Salary: $93k (very stable job, guaranteed annual raises)

**Expenses**

Current Rent: $650/month

Car: Fully paid off, still around 60k miles

Phone: Covered by work

Debt: None other than $20k in school loans, waiting on repayment to start back again in October

Misc: Other than food and other necessities, I don't spend much. I work my full-time job and have a small part-time job on the weekends. Second job doesn't make a lot, but it keeps me from spending money on going out and such.

**Goals**

Really hoping to get a place of my own. Living with roommates has begun to take a toll over the years and I'd like to work on improving my quality of life overall. Things like I love learning how to cook, but three lifestyles going on at once can make that difficult.

Just trying to decide if it would be better to take on a mortgage and try to build equity or find a place to rent for now. Also, with the housing market being where it's at, I'm really unsure what to expect in the coming years. Especially in my location.

**Current Plans**

So as of right now, I've been leaning heavily towards renting since housing prices are so high right now. In addition, I would really like to move closer to my office in downtown as well. Unfortunately though, it seems like downtown is out of question since rent, before add-ons, seems to start around $2k/month (300-600 sqft) which is nearly half my monthly income.

That being said, I've been considering moving towards the Brandon area, about 15 minutes from the office. I've been looking at one starting at $1,755/month (900 sqft). Just not sure if renting is still the best option, and also what dollar amount I should aim for.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I get $1016.00 a month for disability where I live this is almost enough for an apartment…

 To preface I’m old I’ve lived alone and I can’t have roomates or live with anyone other than where I’m at now my sisters house I live on a tiny lump of blankets for the last year I now have an opportunity to get an apartment I’ve fell in love with for a year I have a truck with a truck payment that takes about 300 dollars from my 1016 dollars my sister is willing to help me each month with at least 400 dollars to be able to get this apartment but I would then be rent poor… I have a really decent chunk of back pay from disability I’ve been holding onto just to have for an emergency it’s slowly been dwindling on debt and emergencies meds ect. I have exactly enough left in my savings and checking all my accounts to pay off this truck where I was living prior to my sisters so my question is should I go into the apartment and have savings but slowly they get eaten up and they most certainly will get eaten up more with my own apartment. Or pay off the truck lower my insurance and have the extra 300 dollars a month for rent and things if I did this I would have zero savings ..

I’ve thought a lot about selling the truck it’s a Tacoma in great condition and I don’t drive I get driven once a month to my care so I need a vehicle I really think this one would hold value so I’m not sure on that 

Or just stay at my sisters for another year pay off the truck and save all my money ? Anyone have any advice?

I really need an apartment this is a studio 400 sq ft but it’s mine no privacy issues and I can finally settle in for at least a year

FinancialPlanning,"We are in mid 30s, planning to buy our first house in East coast, US. We liked a house and my wife believes this can be forever house as it meets all our criteria. But wondering if we are going to be house poor. 

Monthly household take home is $17 k after maxing out 401k and some contribution to 529 plan. Excluded $ 40k-50k year end bonus in the take home. 

Planning to put a $ 1 Million offer on a house (20% downpayment) which will be close to a monthly mortgage of $ 7 k including property tax. (6% interest rate) 

Our remaining savings after downpayment and closing costs would be $ 100k+. 

I was aiming for a mortgage of $ 5- 6k per month and I think $ 7k monthly mortgage payment seems high as it will leave only savings of $ 4K after other expenses(6k).   

currently our rent is less than $ 4k which we can continue to live as baby is less than 2 years and we don’t need to move to a good school district next couple of years. 

If interests come down then mortgage payment might come slightly and as baby starts going to school will save the daycare costs. Both together might lead to additional $ 2k - 2500 savings. 

As the house is 20 year old, assuming some of the year end bonus can be allocated for the Maintainance of the house. 

Renting in short term we might save $ 100k per year easily next 2 years. But not sure how the market would be or the interest rates.

Full Context:
Me and my wife make $120K together, in our area we are using chfa and this type of loan gives us a forgivable 2nd loan. Only if my wife does it, I make too much to qualify for it. This gives us 25K towards down payment &amp; we can use up to 13k towards closing cost but that would be a 1% finance so we’d most likely pay for that in full. To be fully transparent we have $60K basically enough for a 250K home. 
-----
Homes we’ve looked at:
The homes we’ve seen are for the most part in a suburban city. A lot especially recently to get a house that is move in ready in this city would have to be $300K + anything under that in the past two years will need around 10k or more close to 20k commonly in repairs. Taxes yearly here on average are $3,000+ and because of chfa pmi is reduced.
-----
What do we do?:
We have a free 25K for a down payment towards any home. Should we save the money we would have used towards the repairs of the house and put it in a high yield savings or do we just pay the remaining portion of the 20% and just keep whatever else we have and we should be fine regardless?
-----
What will we purchase / do in the future?:
I mean year one of purchasing a house I'm sure we'd do repairs and then relax, the year after probably have a kid and get a new car probably 30K+ on the car alone. And I think that'd be the majority of expenses also one of us will probably go back to college so school expenses.
-----
Based on all this information, and what is going on with inflation &amp; the housing market, interest rates. What would you guys say save the 60k high yield savings with reduced pmi probably 30k to 45kish or pay the 20% and repairs and do what we can with the remaining 5k - 15kish ?

FinancialPlanning,"Friends, 

I am 35 years old with about 29k in a 457 account, in a 2050 target date fund. In 2021 I began working at a job with a pension system, and it is a decent and reliable pension. If i work there until 62 I can probably pull in between 30 to 35k a year from that pension. I put 250 every paycheck into my 457 account and make a total of about 78k a year. I intend to raise the contribution amount over time, especially if I get a raise (I'd like to get to 300 per paycheck). 

There is part of me that feels woefully behind my savings for retirement. Am I on track? Am I overthinking it and should I just plug more and more money into my 457?

FinancialPlanning,"I am battling whether I should continue to keep contributing to my current Traditional IRA or do a back door Roth.

**Context:

33 yr old male, married, one child and another on the way. Max out both my 401k and IRA yearly along with HSA. Income is north of $125k ($95k salary, rest is commission and I am usually more then this but just being conservative), wife runs her own business that gross about $25-40k yearly.I’m in tech sales so hard to accurately determine what every year will look like but my income has gradually increased by $10-15kk yearly so imagine the further I get in my career, the more potential I have to earn more.

Own a home. Between my wife and I we have a total of $162k in retirement accts ($65k in employer 401k and $97k across both of our Trad IRA’s) along with $72k in an individual brokerage acct which I plan on continuing to contribute $150+ (most likely much more but being conservative) a month and using this as a retirement acct until we can withdrawal from retirement accts without penalties. 6 months emergency expenses in savings and no debt other then our mortgage, $2,250 month. I also contribute about $300/month to our child’s 529, will be splitting that across the two kids soon.

**Where I need help: 

With our combined income, I am battling what to do with our IRA’s, stay trad or move back door to Roth. Only reason I haven’t yet is because I am working towards retiring from the full corporate environment early, shooting for 50-55 and feel that the closer I get to retirement, the more I would like to transition out of sales and do something a little more enjoyable, possibly work at local golf courses. Of course this would be a big pay cut but our tax rate would also drop significantly, would continue to work part time for benefits and consistent income coming in to help. I figure by the time we begin withdrawing from the IRA accts, our tax rate will be significantly lower then it would if I paid the taxes on it right now by converting to a Roth. Basically don’t know if paying taxes in the prime of my career is smart.

**Question: 

Based on the info shared, is this an accurate expectation? Am I missing anything causing me to reconsider switching now? Would it make sense to even switch at this point knowing that I would be looking at a big upfront tax bill?

•1st floor small apartment that can rent for 2k/mo  
•2nd floor studio space that I will use for work - conservatively will make $7,000/mo year round  
•3rd floor apartment that I will live in or rent for 3k/mo if I need a bigger space
•huge garden area to grow food  

I have money to buy this house outright, but have to liquidate stocks that are sitting roughly around where they were in 2019 (like everyone else, I lost lots of money in the market the past year) I have lost roughly what I will pay for the house. 

My income now comes from renting a house that I own that is 5 min from this home and seasonal work in the summer. This would increase my income by that $7000/mo + $2,000/mo if I choose to rent the bottom right away (don’t really need the money at the moment, so maybe I will have my mom move in to help me) 

Right now in my area I am paying $4,000/mo for a 1 bed apartment and only working seasonally because I don’t have a studio space in the winter. I own the other home that I rent outright (no mortgage) &amp; the cash purchase of this home will take 1/5 of the stock portfolio I would have to pull from. 

Is it worth it to liquidate stocks that have hugely decreased in price to make this happen, or is it best to hold off for a few more years?

Potential cons:
This house has been on the market for a year as it’s not a functional home for a family, it will only work for someone with a vision for business. My first offer (declined) was $200k less than asking because of this. They bought it for essentially what I offered them roughly 20 years ago, so it seems there isn’t much growth potential in the property value for this one, but lots of opportunity to make money from it from a business perspective + it will be harder to sell than a normal house in the area.",t2_uqxlljwl,0,Would liquidating stocks to buy an investment home/business be a silly idea?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,10i0fhu,True,throwaway9183757281,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10i0fhu/would_liquidating_stocks_to_buy_an_investment/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10i0fhu/would_liquidating_stocks_to_buy_an_investment/,516779,1674332062,0,,False,1674332074,1674491816,2023-01-21 20:14:22,,,,,,

I am in a very blessed position where I won’t be paying rent for the next couple of years and only really pay for food. 100-200$ per paycheck.

Goals:
- Retire early. 40’s - early 50’s.
- Gift 30K to my mother as a down payment towards a house (next 2-4 years.)
- be able to donate to non profit orgs later on down the line or maybe create one myself.

FinancialPlanning,"Hey guys so i didn’t really want to talk about this as it’s embarrassing to me that I would even allow myself to do this, but I developed a spending addiction on comics.

My whole life even as a kid I never did enjoy anything and I guess because of that I was desperate to feel something, but of course it didn’t work. Just to show how bad this was, I had $2,500 in the bank 2 months ago and I was down to $600 this month.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi, 

I’m a 24 year old nurse and my income for the 2022 year was $86k.
I just received a raise where I will be in the 24% tax bracket for the 2023 year. 

I currently have $28k in private student loans and approx. $40k in government student loans.
I have a private loan for my car, approx. $12k.

I currently have $7k in a savings account and my monthly expenses are approx. $2.2k (including loan payments).

I have just spent the last year and a half building a credit score and have met my goal, yay! And now have 3 months of living expenses in my savings account for emergency funds.

At this point, I think I’m ready to start investing. However, I do have a ton of student loans (I may have to start paying the government loans after the grace period this year) and this will change my monthly expenses throughout the next few years.

My job currently provides a 403b, but from my understanding this would not be a good idea for investment as I plan to leave this job in 2 years and they do not match contributions. 

So, I was looking into rIRA and tIRA. I plan to go back to school, an expected raise of income to around $120k at least depending on NP school or CRNA school once I pay off my current private loans.

Doing some research, expecting a raise of income throughout my life, the rIRA makes more sense because of my change in tax brackets and potential for future 401k investments after a job change.

Is this correct? Is rIRA my best choice right now?

Are there any other things I should look into to meet my goal of a reasonable retirement age? (50-60 y.o)

Do you see any mistakes I may be making with my financial choices so far?

I currently have all of my investments in VOO, and I feel pretty safe about it. I've seen a lot of talk about leverage recently, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to commit to something like the Hedgefundie strategy. So, I was wondering if doing something like 80% VOO and 20% UPRO would make sense.

I've heard a lot of people talk about decaying and all that, but generally speaking, the stock market goes up around 53.3% of days and down 46.7% of days, with up days usually outperforming most down days from data spanning decades. So, I would think that since the market will probably go up, having 20% into something like UPRO would make sense to potentially 1.5x my ROI?

FinancialPlanning,"The circumstances of my life have changed drastically in the past few years and it’s time for me to buy a “forever” home. I found one that might be perfect. 

It is a 3-floor home in the center of town (good retail space):
•1st floor small apartment that can rent for 2k/mo
•2nd floor studio space that I will use for work - conservatively will make $7,000/mo year round
•3rd floor apartment that I will live in or rent for 3k/mo if I need a bigger space
•huge garden area to grow food 

I have money to buy this house outright, but have to liquidate stocks that are sitting roughly around where they were in 2019 (like everyone else, I lost lots of money in the market the past year) I have lost roughly what I will pay for the house. 

My income now comes from renting a house that I own that is 5 min from this home and seasonal work in the summer. This would increase my income by that $7000/mo + $2,000/mo if I choose to rent the bottom right away (don’t really need the money at the moment, so maybe I will have my mom move in to help me) 

Right now in my area I am paying $4,000/mo for a 1 bed apartment and only working seasonally because I don’t have a studio space in the winter. I own the other home that I rent outright (no mortgage) &amp; the cash purchase of this home will take 1/5 of the stock portfolio I would have to pull from.

FinancialPlanning,"Please Critique My Budget! 

Hi. I live in a very high cost of living (VHCOL) area. My husband and I both work full time and just bought a condo at a 2% mortgage interest rate. We’ve always been very careful to live within our means, but I feel like we’ve reached a bit of a plateau with our personal finances recently. 

I contribute 20% to my 401(k) with a 6% match and my husband contributes 6% to his with a 6% match. The reason for the disparity is an effort to get our 401(k)s to similar levels - he’s had his much longer. 

My husband also takes part in his Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) at 10% and regularly gets small Restricted Stock Units (RSU). 

Together, based on our W-2s, we earned $229,466.30 in 2022. This includes our bonuses, and, I think, the RSUs and ESPP. Our tax bracket is 24% ($30,427.00 plus 24% after $178,150, so $42,742.91 for 2022). 

We own outright two vehicles, but despite all efforts my husband’s beloved old family van is on its last leg and will likely be replaced with an electric or hybrid vehicle when it dies. 

We have no credit card/education/personal debt. Our mortgage is our only debt.

FinancialPlanning,"So I've been working at my current company for a couple months now and I just want to know about how much should I keep in my checking account. I live with my parents so my expenses are pretty non-existent. I just want to be prepared in case of a layoff (although I don't see that likely happening for us anytime soon, still id rather be prepared)

So currently I make 70k/yr and my only real expense is gas (probably ~$200/mo, I drive about an hour to work) and my student loan payments (I have 100k student loan debt, I know it's not great. Minimum payments on those are ~$1600/mo I believe). I also have car insurance which is about $200/mo. I own my car so no payments on that. Other expenses are pretty minimal, i have a couple subscriptions for things like Netflix and disney plus but those might add up to be ~$100/mo if I'm being really conservative with the price (obviously i could cancel these if i got laid off but i like watching my shows so ill keep them for now). Other than this I don't spend much, maybe the occasional go out to eat but my parents take care of all the food and house expenses. 

Mostly wondering this so I can start putting as much money into my student loans as possible to pay them off as quickly as possible but I don't want to leave myself with no money.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello all, 

I just started a new job that earns $60k/yr. This is to date, my highest annual salary, but I am also newly divorced. Oddly enough, this is the most financially stable I’ve ever been, aside from summer 2020.

The real question here is:

I have about $4.5k in an IRA from a previous job. I have the option to roll it into the IRA offered at this job. HOWEVER, I do not plan on contributing to an IRA because this employer does not offer an IRA matching program, instead they have a pension (SEIU affiliated).

I'd like to eventually convert them to ROTH IRA for it's benefits around not getting taxed on capital gains. I'm trying to figure out when to convert to ROTH.  I have questions around 2 scenarios.

1) if I convert the IRA to Roth now before I invest anything in the new IRA account, I assume I pay taxes on the $10k I just rolled over.  Correct?

2) Let's assume I don't convert to Roth right away and start making investments in the IRA account and my $10K is $100K by next year and next year I decide to convert to ROTH, am I paying taxes on the $10K I originally rolled over or on the $100k?

FinancialPlanning,"So I unwittingly over-contributed to my (only) Roth IRA for both TY2022 and TY2023. $6k and $6.5k, respectively. My income quickly grew from years prior (gratefully) and I was, up until very recently, unaware of the relevant limitations. 2023 has just begun, but if I keep my current job (I expect to), my AGI for both years was and will be over the limit to be eligible to contribute anything at all to a Roth IRA.

I've already got a (also the only) Traditional IRA comprised of pre-tax money from a previous employer 401k rollover in the amount of $33k.

I presume I will encounter the 6% excise tax penalty for the first time when preparing my taxes for TY2022, so I'd like to mitigate it before I get started on that.

My options, as far as I can tell:

1. Withdraw the total overage using the ""I over-contributed"" reason and eat the 10% penalty, which would amount to ~1.2k
2. Re-characterize those contributions over to the Traditional IRA, and consider implementing the backdoor Roth procedure

I'm a bit fuzzy on (2), but if I understand it correctly, I can, if I wish, roll those funds _back_ into the Roth IRA at a later date (when...?), and work around the Roth IRA contribution limit each tax year using the same procedure (Roth-&gt;Traditional-&gt;Roth). I'll owe income tax on a pro-rated basis for any pre-tax money that was in the Traditional IRA when rolling back into Roth characterization. If I did this procedure later this year, I would add ~9.2k of taxable income for TY2023, and need to pay federal and state income taxes on that money at my current marginal rate. Sound right so far?

In the case where I proceed with the re-characterization and backdoor Roth procedure: do I then roll back into the Roth every year, or leave contributions characterized as Traditional until such time that I am eligible and ready to use that money (and possibly in a lower tax bracket), and then roll it? I suppose one downside with waiting could be that the law might change, but if I pay better attention, I'll likely have enough notice before such a change to transition the funds before any new law takes effect.

For context, my larger financial picture is pretty healthy at the moment. I've no debt and a reasonable safety net. My most immediate financial goal is to save a large down payment for a real estate purchase in the coming 1-2 years. If I withdraw the IRA money now and take the penalty, I could realize that savings goal faster. But it's highly unlikely that I'll be ready to buy any sooner than 1 year out for other reasons, and I expect to be able to have that money either way by then (barring unforeseeable extenuating circumstances/catastrophe).

Further questions:

1. Have I understood this correctly?
2. Have I overlooked/not mentioned anything that I ought to be aware of?
3. What do you think is my best course of action given what I have laid out?

I understand that to build a home (custom, spec, or other) on your own plot of land you need a construction loan and the land paid for to use as collateral.   
  
What loan type is required for the “spec home” communities? Essentially, you’re still purchasing land and having a home built on it - although the land is somewhat predetermined and the homes are going to be built regardless, in many cases, to fill the available lots.   
  
Do you have to purchase the plot first with cash prior to commencing the build? What if you purchase a home mid-build? I’d assume that purchasing one of these homes after construction has completed would be no different than a traditional home purchase.

FinancialPlanning,"I am 19 years old. 

Make $60,000 a year. Save $3200 a month after company 401k 5% to get their match. ($3,000 a year)

I was doing 29% into my 401k in hopes to get $17,500 in by next year to at least be close to maxing it. I am saving $32,000/yr by doing this. I thought i was set and it was the best option. 

Upon further analysis, I have made a realization that by doing this Im putting $17,500 away to never be used until retirement when I could be storing it in T-bills or an HySA gaining interest to save for passive income streams that require significant capital to start (ie rental properties, raw land, an app i am wanting to develop, etc) 

I opened up a calculator that measures 401k expectations, and to my Surprise it says if i continue this path for 45 more years, I will only have $800,000 in gains after putting in $708,000. Total of 1,508,000. 

In my mind, if I would to obtain a rental property(s), in long term I could build real wealth much faster and have the ability to expand at a much higher rate and have access to money all my life.

So all in all, Should I trust my path of 29% in 401k forever or put the 5% company match and save up to invest in my hopeful endeavors?

FinancialPlanning,"Cross posting for more input:

Hi everyone - looking for informative opinions on our situation.

Current home - 
Purchased Early 2019 $360,000, currently owe $320,000 at 2.6% with monthly escrow and HOA payment of $1770 in desirable neighborhood of a suburb of a major metro. New house built in 2019 so no major concerns with roof, foundation, etc. HOA handles landscaping for front yard, backyard is drip system, turf and pavers so almost no maintenance. 

Option A:
We can rent this home for approximately $2200-$2500 per month, and know someone interested that is trusted with stable income so we can skip the property management company and just offer at $2200. 

Option B:
We can sell in a declining market, but again still a desirable area. Selling price would probably be $515,000 to $540,000 in the current market. Similar homes in the neighborhood were selling at $680,000 in late 2021, so we have realistic/low expectations with the above numbers. 

So do we capitalize on the equity now or keep the house a few years, knowing we can sell within 5 years of moving and avoid capital gains tax or do we get into the rental game and start building some passive income?

My spouse and I are in our mid 30s, decent 401K accounts ($160k), cash savings of $90k so far for the new house down payment, but need $112k by close date in June. (Already gave builder $72,000 cash for earnest and upgrades)

Income and current bills info:
Combined yearly pretax income - $350k to $450k ($230k to $330k commission sales fluctuate for one income, the other is stable $120k) 
Auto loans and car insurance- $1830/month - two vehicles 
Daycare - $2800/month 
Current Mortgage/escrow/hoa - $1770/month
Phones, streaming apps, and internet - $350/month

We’ve scheduled a meeting with a tax and financial advisor for next month where we’ll also ask questions, but what are the advantages and disadvantages for property management from an income and tax perspective that are major factors we should consider?

Generally we are low risk type people, both grew up in low income environments so we haven’t really seen good financial modeling or have any family to advise or ask, hence Reddit. 

The why: 
We are moving into a bigger home because we are about to become a family of 5 and current house is a 3 bed 2 bath 1565 sqft house where we wfh - it has been just fine for two kids (no guest room, no dining room, no playroom, no separate offices, just all in the kitchen/dining/living spaces) but with three we are going to be a little too tight - so life happens. 

New house - Assuming $20% down. 
Loan of $730k at 5.25% (no buy down)
Mortgage/escrow/hoa - $5025/month

I’m trying to pay for this semester and it’s been really hard. Ever since my father died in 2020, my family and I have been struggling to get everything settled. Originally, I had to pay around $4414 for 4 classes. My mom said that she would need to get some money out of her bank to pay (And it doesn’t help that my mom got frustated at us about this since she is not good with knowing about the college system and finances). 

My sister who just graduated decided to help figure out why the tuition is so high. We have called the financial aid office as well the aid office of our college. They don’t help at all. I figured out that I had to make corrections to my 2022-2023 FAFSA which kinda helped. It’s just that I was unable to earn any grants since the numbers I put were high. Still, I was unable to apply for scholarships since the application for spring semester are closed. 

Now, since the FAFSA application was edited, it went back up to full price (which is around $7000-$8000). We have been trying to keep in contact with the financial aid office and bursar office, but now we are struggling to find certain parts of the 2021 tax to give proof to them (such as schedule 1 and 3). We are hoping that the FAFSA went through, but tuition is due on Monday. I don’t wanna have to apply for the payment plan again because we will have to pay $45 fee.

Hello I'm a married 55f with a teenager at home. We are still making mortgage payments on our home. We have 2 paid off vehicles. Other than our monthly living expenses we don't really have any debt. We have a little in savings which we'll need to pay for our kids college expenses, my husband has a 401k and I have an IRA. Should we have a will even though our only real debt is our mortgage? What would an attorney charge for something like this? I heard about Trust &amp; Will online app where you can do one for $159. Does anyone have experience with that platform? Are they any good or are there better online options?

Also should we have a financial advisor? I am unemployed with no job prospects on the horizon. My husband has a good FT job and the 3 of us squeak by on his salary. He puts the max amount into his 401k each month but we don't have extra to invest in anything else, so I'm not clear on how an advisor could help us.  We are already very frugal and have cut out any unnecessary expenses.

FinancialPlanning,"Hey guys, I’m pretty new into my career after college, and I would love to get some advice to help manage my money.

I’m 22, graduated college in May 2022, I started working at my current job in insurance in October. My car is paid for and i’m currently still under my family’s auto and health insurance. My partner (28) and I currently live with my parents, so we are extremely blessed to not have any rent or utility expenses. She is 8.5 months pregnant (so excited!) so she’s not currently working.

Income:
I make $27,000/yr (in South Carolina) and I take home about $1.8k/mo after taxes (not including commissions, but those go straight into savings). I’ve got about $3,300 in savings right now and my credit score is 709

Debt: 
I have $16,500 in student loans, which are currently deferred (still accruing interest though) which I have not had to make any payments on. I really would be happy if my student debt is cancelled, but i’m definitely going to be ready if that does not happen.

I have only one line of credit open, a Discover card with 0% APR until 06/04/23. I owe about $1,400 on it with a minimum payment of $35/mo, but usually put about $100-$200 into it each month.

Budget:
I provide for both myself and my partner, and soon our little one. We spend about-
$400-$500/mo on groceries (we have WIC so that helps a bit)
$70/mo eating out/date nights
$200/mo gas (drive about 40mins to work one 
way)
$70-$150/mo shopping (baby stuff and miscellaneous needs)
$30/month for entertainment (streaming, music)

Goals:
I would really like to be able to get a modest house for my little family. I qualify for most home loans, including USDA (but with my current debt to income ratio, it could only get me a ~$70,000 home which not be ideal for the market here). I considered renting, but that would be a huge money pit and i’d basically be saving no money at all.

I don’t have any kind of IRA so i would love to set one up. I’m not really sure what to look for but i know it would be a good idea.

Gross pay is 130k USD/year which equates to $3700\~ take home every two weeks. I recently got a raise and was previously making 90k USD/year. My wife and I are terrible at following a budget and often overspend on home improvement/decor.

My wife is currently in between jobs, but works as a waitress and takes home about 300/week when working. This money is purely her spending money and doesn't factor into our budget when she has a job. Obviously when she doesn't have a job, she is spending more on our joint account, but that is not reflected in this budget.

We have about 16k in savings that is accruing \~3.8% interest, but only a few thousand in 401k. This is because in 2021 we ended up using my 401k to put money down on a home.

While we have an estimated budget, we honestly don't watch our spending when it comes to groceries. We eat what we eat, and we feel that there is value in not limiting ourselves in that regard.

Both our vehicles are paid off, but i did just have to spend around $4k on repairs... so that sort of nullifies the benefit of not having car payments.

FinancialPlanning,"I think I know the answer to this already, but wanted to confirm since most articles I have read don’t clearly state it. If I have both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, does the $6,000 max contribution for the year mean that it is split between the two? For example, putting $3,000 into both equaling the total of $6,000 for the year. Or since one is Traditional and the other is a Roth, does it allow you to put in $6,000 into each account?

I’m guessing it is $6,000 total between the two, but I just did a rollover Traditional IRA with an old 401k and wondered if I could put in an extra $6,000 before the tax season gets here. I already hit $6,000 contribution on my Roth IRA for 2022.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello all, 

I’ve been a lurker here for a while. 
Growing up my family made terrible money AND were terrible with their money as well.

I was never taught anything about how to manage money and so I’m trying to fix my poor habits and start anew. I just got engaged, and I have a wedding due for October ‘24. 

Here is the situation: I’m 26, and I make $60,000 a year salary. I bring home $4,000 a month. I contribute some very low amount ($25) to a Roth IRA I started in after high school through an app called *Acorns*. I work in education, so I have an additional retirement account through TRS, the Teacher Retirement System. My shared bills (or things that I split with my fiancé) are $1449.38 a month. All my personal bills amount to $1092.95. I have $1457.67 to my name after I pay my bills. I use about $200 worth of gas a month and I usually reserve myself $100 a week for things I may need, or to go out to eat for lunch occasionally. That leaves about $800 (rounding) left over. I have no savings as of now.

I have three credit cards, two I have reduced from being maxed out to being empty over the past two months. One sits now at $0/$2500 and one sits at $0/$1800. The other is a medical credit card that sits at $0/$1500. 

I have one student loan in a state where I don’t have to pay on it at the moment. It sits at around $3000. 

I have a car note that sits at $40,000ish.

Given I know absolutely nothing about rules of thumb or any other accumulates financial tips/tricks, where do you all suggest I go from here? I want to save and build financial security for myself and my fiancé (she makes $64,000 a year salary).

FinancialPlanning,"I'm 23, single and make no more than $1400 a month, I live with my parents so my money has been piling up and sitting in a money market account for years and years and I have no plans to touch it for a very long time. I started looking up ways to make it grow and discovered that I should start planning for retirement and open a Roth IRA and invest in Index Funds.

After looking around I'm interested in opening an account with Vanguard. I've heard that there are limits to how much you can contribute, but also that you can contribute for the previous year and the current year if you do it in the January-April interval. I believe the limit was $6,000 for 2022, and $6,500 for 2023. I am fully capable of comfortably investing up to $12,500 at one time (I have no expenses and have plenty of savings/emergency fund).

I don't want to worry about timing the market, I just know investing something sooner rather than later is best. If I only have until April to contribute for the 2022 year, I imagine I'd have to contribute $6k by lump sum, bump sum, or do dollar-cost averaging by April before the deadline for 2022 contributions. Then I'd have until April 2024 to figure out how and when to invest the maximum $6,500 for the 2023 year.

1. Just to get some insight, what is everyone doing now in terms of lump/bump sum and DCA? I imagine it'd be best to DCA until April (if there is a dramatic drop before then, to lump sum) to be on the safe side.
2. If I open up an account with Vanguard and max out 2022 with a $6k contribution, could I also do share certificates through Vanguard or would that be considered overcontributing? My bank offers share certificates as well but Vanguard has better rates. (So for example could I max out 2022 contributions with $6k and open a share certificate of $5k or so at the same time, or would that count toward my $6.5k contributions for 2023?)
3. And how do I know if I overcontribute? When learning about Roth IRAs I hear this is a common issue, so for my income I wanted to double-check my numbers of $6k by April and an additional $6.5k from now to next April is the maximum. Again I'm single and make no more than $1400 a month, my family has an accountant that files all our taxes for us so I could confirm with them but wanted to know if there was a way to actually check your maximum without just looking at some chart for general use.
4. Do I need to tell my accountant to report my contributions? I've heard about Saver's Tax Credits(?) but I didn't want to bombard them with too many questions.

I'm still new to all of this and wanted to make sure I have the right idea about how Roth IRAs and investing works with share certificates for some extra, safe small returns on the side. If anyone has thoughts on any of the points above or just general tips/advice on beginner investors I'd appreciate it.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all. A quick backstory: my brother and I purchased a house together in July 2019. He and his girlfriend live in the house. My wife purchased a house in April 2021 where we now live. She and I plan to upgrade houses in 1-2 years - either when the right one comes along or when we find land to build upon.  We would list her home contingent with new home. 
  
My brother wants to buy land and build as his next house, so I/we don’t have any definitive timeframe on him moving out or wanting to sell.   
  
What options do I have for my joint mortgage with my brother? I worry that having 2 mortgages (one is mine, one is my wife’s) will complicate her and I’s process of obtaining a mortgage for our next home.   
  
One option would be to refinance to remove me from the mortgage and deed. Is this the only way? I don’t want to force him into an unfair financial situation as the joint mortgage was a mutual decision initially.   
  
In the eyes of a lender, would it change things on his end when going for his own construction loan if he would refinance in his name only? I know they count all debt toward the DTI regardless of what portion we currently pay, so theoretically they would factor in the whole mortgage payment in either case.

FinancialPlanning,"
Hi, I’m 29 and married. My wife and I have both increased our incomes over the past year and we moved into a house. No plans for kids. 

While it feels like we are moving forward, I also don’t feel like we are managing our money as well as we could or making it work for us. I also have ~35k net bonus coming in July this year.  We just bought and furnished our home so that also eliminated a good amount of savings we had. 

Anyone have advice or critiques on what we are doing or what they would do differently? To be honest, I know we are spending high in certain areas and that’s a choice, but I do want to be aware and balanced. 

Income:
- Me: 155k gross($3,770 take home every 2 weeks)
-35k bonus in July this year 
- Wife: 80k-ish gross ($2,200 take home every 2 weeks)

- my Savings:$4k
- wife savings: 2k
w
We both contribute enough to our 401k to get the company match. My company matches 2%.  I also contribute about $220 per month to my HSA. (5k in there now)

Debts:
- 2 car loans
- 1 Mortgage
- ~7k in cc debt
- ~8k in student loans (currently paused)


My Monthly Budget, for the most part we try to live off my income:

- Mortgage payment: $2,780
- my car payment: $648
- phone bill(total for both):$200
- internet : $35(new account discounts)
- gym: $80
- electric: $170-200
- water/trash: $80
- auto insurance(total for both):$160
- personal spending(groceries,gas , restaurants etc): $400/wk
- minimum cc payment:$150
- savings/extra debt payment: $1450

(I also get reimbursed for my internet and phone so get about $350 back per quarter)


My wife’s budget(much less defined) 
- $2k or more to savings
- she may go shopping or pay for some meals
- $1k car payment(considering if I should put this in my budget in place of some of my savings and then she could save even more)",t2_ckjn0vm1,0,"29M - Please advise, critique,roast my budget!",[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,10esjif,True,Altruistic-Resist-12,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10esjif/29m_please_advise_critiqueroast_my_budget/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10esjif/29m_please_advise_critiqueroast_my_budget/,513969,1674001414,0,,False,1674001432,1674001433,2023-01-18 00:23:34,,,,,,

FinancialPlanning,"Hello!

Basically, I am considering a transfer to a new position. I’m not sure if my situation warrants a withdraw or potentially transfer and loan out from my 401K. I do not know the pitfalls here and would appreciate any info! 

Brief summary of important info:

- I’m a mid-senior level engineer with a fairly decent job. Paid below the 25% for my area though. 

- I am a final candidate for another position paying significantly more. It requires relocation. Wife and I are ok with that. Not 100%, but feels 80% that I’ll at least secure an offer. It is my dream to work at this place. 

This is plan A. 

- I have side gigs I do that can maintain my current way of living. A personal LLC which pulled me ~$2600 this last week. 

This is plan B.

- If* it hits the fan I could dip in my 401K as I maxed contributions for years since starting. It is now enough to live off confidently if I took a loan on it.

This is plan C.

- I have a plan D, very similar to my current job that pays higher base than currently and is hourly vs salary with overtime. The rub is that it’s in Arkansas. Open offer on this one.

- I own a house on a VA loan. Would profit on sell. Never sold a house though.

- Wife and I plan to have a little one within ~2 years. She works now but wouldn’t after.

My current employer knows I am dissatisfied and looking to improve my quality of life.

FinancialPlanning,"I am racked up with $7.5k in credit card debt across 3 credit cards.   
1. Discover - $3k maxed   
2. Bank of America - $3k maxed   
3. Citibank - $1.5k maxed   
all due to automotive repair bills and other misc items. This debt first got accumulated since the summer of 2022 and I have been trying to repay back what I owe but it always climbs back up due to my poor spending habits.   


I currently work making $20/hr in downtown LA and get paid about $3k a month (after taxes) or $1.5k every two weeks.   
My monthly mandatory expenses sum up to about $1.2k and this includes gas, rent, daily $9 parking for work, and bills.  
I live paycheck to paycheck and the way I have been budgeting myself has been like this:   
**biweekly:**   
$1500 check  
$500 for necessities, $500 to pay off credit card with highest interest (BoFa), $200 for myself, and $300 left over for my gas and parking until I get my next paycheck the following 2 weeks. By the end of the 2 weeks, Im left with about less than $100, sometimes even less than $50 right before my next paycheck hits. It makes me depressed lol.   


So in total, Ideally, I'm making about $1000 payments on my debt, but due to my spending habits and going out with friends and my girlfriend, it fluctuates those $1000 to about $500-600 at best towards my debt, monthly. That is essentially what im doing right now and it's not working for me apparently. I haven't made a dent in my debt at all despite almost a year of me having it.  


I am considering selling my only car, a 30 year old honda, and using the money to pay off my debt and just commuting straight to work saving me hundreds on gas and parking. I do have the metro easily accessible for me and it can take me straight to and from work, but I have had a really bad experience with the metro making it uncomfortable and unsettling for me due to the unpredictable people that go on it. In addition, I feel like I will be emotionally distressed as I love my car and really enjoy driving. However, I know if I sell my car it will be financially smart and really alleviate the debt that I have failed to pay for the past 6 months. I wouldn't want to sell my car but if it is the most popular advice from you guys, I will do it, I guess. Otherwise, I would really love to hear your advice for me, any helps.

FinancialPlanning," Hello Reddit, we are planning on moving into an apartment in our capital city. The contract has already been signed and we need to pay by the 30th of April. Now the Ukraine war has affected the house prices in our town but not the city so we are stuck with a buyer on our hands that is willing to pay just a little bit more than what the new apartment cost and after the taxes and moving expenses it would be basically the same. Now a big reason for our move from the house was to get rid of the majority of the debt but that isn't going to work normally. We have already considered a load of options but none of them really worked out, so I am wondering if there is any other way we could somehow keep the apartment and maybe somehow sell the house for what its actually worth in a year or so or anything of sorts that would allow us to move and somehow get the money from the actual worth of the house. Now we already considered renting the house or just taking two mortgages but it wouldn't work out. Are we screwed and have to sell the apartment or is there somehow a plan C we missed?

FinancialPlanning,"Handling Credit Card Debt

Hi all! As the title shows, I am looking for advice on how to handle my credit card debt. Currently right now I have about 6500 on three different cards, which I know in the grand scheme of things is a whole lot, but it’s still affecting my credit score. And with interest rates rising on everything, I would like to keep my score as high as possible for future loans. Should I start with my smallest card, pay that debt off and put it away? Should I do my biggest card with the most debt first even though it’ll take longer? Should I continue to pay equally on all? Something else entirely?

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all. I am a 23-year-old woman who graduated last May and has been working full-time for six months now. I live in New York, my gross salary is $60k, and the net is about $46k. 

I have twenty thousand dollars saved up and about nine thousand dollars in student loans (which have paused payments right now). I am eager to move out, although I would prefer to wait and purchase as opposed to rent. 

So, my goal plan is about eighteen to twenty-four more months of saving before I begin searching for a home.

I have definitely been slacking in terms of going to the bank, and all of my savings are currently sitting in an old student checking account I have. I am wondering if I should move this money to a standard savings account or go with a high-yield savings account like So-Fi to help grow it for a future down payment, etc. 

My hesitations with this include: I don't know how safe online banks like So-Fi are and how would the liquidation process work in the event of a home purchase if all my money is in that account. 

Finally, I also would like to start saving for retirement, even if just a little, to get that started. My employer does not currently do a 401K match, so does that mean I should open a Roth?

FinancialPlanning,"I am new to Reddit and very new to investing. I've learned some basic things about Roth IRAs, Index Funds, and Bonds, but I still don't have any confidence in how they truly work and how I can start investing, especially since I want to eventually live and retire in Japan.

I am 23, over $50-60k in savings/money market. At most I get $15-20 a month in interest. No investment or retirement accounts whatsoever. I live with my parents, no expenses, so my money is just sitting in my savings/money market account. I am half-Japanese, I have a US Passport and plan to get a Japanese one soon. I am employed at my family business and I don't file taxes myself, everything is handled by our family accountant so I have no knowledge about tax filing, either.

I plan to stay with my parents for as long as possible and ideally I'd like to move as soon as the family business is sold and my parents retire (no timeline for this, could be at least as long as 5-10 years from now). In the meantime I'd work on improving my Japanese and move when I'm confident in the language and hopefully at that time I'll have investments and a retirement plan. So:

1) Roth IRAs/Index Funds. I read somewhere that these get complicated or there is no point in starting a Roth IRA if you plan to move to Japan before retirement. Is this true? After looking up information on investing I have interest in Index Funds/possibly Bonds, for low risk investing over time, but is this something that can't be done if I want to eventually move to Japan? I imagine it'd be equally impossible to try to open retirement/investing accounts in Japan from the US without any solid plans on when I could live and start working there (+ I don't have my Japanese passport yet).

2) If investing/retirement is complicated due to my desire to move and retire in Japan and lack of a timeline for this, is there any way I can invest and take out money in the short-term? Are share certificates my only short-term safe option for growing money until I figure out how I can invest and move to Japan for retirement?  I don't need significant returns, I just want to be doing something rather than nothing until I'm sure I can open a Roth IRA and start Index Funds/Bonds/investing without running into tax complications when moving to Japan and trying to manage everything from there.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi everyone!

I think most of us are now aware of the new 529 provision where we can roll over up to $35,000 (up to the annual contribution max) into the beneficiary’s Roth IRA if the account is open for 15 years and the contribution was made at least 5 years prior to the rollover. 

With that being said, does it almost make more sense to open 3 different accounts - one for my daughter, one for my husband, and one for myself and ideally have about $35,000 in each one by the time she starts college. This seems like a great way to reduce risk of unused funds. If she doesn’t need any of the money, it’ll go to her Roth IRA, and the accounts for my husband and I would also go to our own IRAs. If she needs all the money for qualifying expenses, we can do a rollover from our own 529s to her account and use all $105,000 for college. Just seems like it reduces the risk of saving $100k+ in her account and her not needing it since all of that money can be rolled over penalty free.

I’ve been in for a little over a year now and just turned 20 (single, no dependents). One of my resolutions for this year was to manage and save money better, but I’m not sure where to start. Currently, I’m switching over from PNC to Navy Federal because of a recommendation from a friend. I’ve also seen some posts about investing with their savings or finding banks with high APY but I don’t have any knowledge of that either. Close to half of my paycheck goes towards paying off a car/insurance, internet/phone, and other needs, so I haven’t started saving anything yet.

I've recently started a job in a technological field, and I have started to save a big percentage of my pay each month. So far, I have saved around 12k USD, and next month the sum will be more than 15k USD (and will continue growing at a similar rate).

Thus far, I have saved them in a savings account in my Bank that yields around 3% annually, but I don't think it's the best way for me to save, which is why I came here.

I am saving for financial security when I grow up. I want to be able to afford things, and having a large sum of money at my age will make me financially stable, for now, and independent. I plan to save for a long-term time, and I want to know how I should save this sum of money in order to get the best results.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello,

Does maxing out 457b government plan make sense with no match and would Roth or pretax be better to max out? I am a bit behind with retirement investing due to paying off debt quickly which might of been dumb decision but enjoy the piece of mind owning everything out right.

Currently in my last year of my 20s single with no kids. Current salary 54k work offers 70-90 cent raise each anniversary year and a cola in July of 2-3%. I pay Federal tax 22% and no state income tax. If I complete 30 years of service with work a state pension will be provided but no social security as work does not contribute to it. Have no debt so car and house paid off. Current budget for the month is 800 for utilities, hoa, insurance, food, entertainment etc. Emergency fund of 6 months is set as well. Which would leave roughly $2,900 left for the month to save or invest. 

I’ve gathered that rule of thumb is usually max out work retirement 401k/457b etc. Roth IRA, HSA, 529 and eventually taxable brokerage.

Part of me hates the fact I tie up my money and unable to touch until I retire if I make it till that age cause I almost died to stage 3 cancer 8 years ago but back of mind I know I have to do it if I want to have a nest egg to live out my years when I do make it to retirement.

Anyways any suggestions of what to do would be much appreciated and if I left something out I’ll update or answer it. I rather manage my own money than pay a financial advisor as well.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello everyone, 

I recently just opened a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA at fidelity. I've been reading a lot and want to take advantage of the backdoor Roth. However, I'm unsure about the best path to accomplish this and also keep investing for retirement. I was planning to initiate the rollover of the 6K limit to the Roth IRA all at once in one go, but what then? Do I keep contributing and investing inside the traditional IRA? Does that make sense to do is there risks or tax liabilities or rules around doing that after the rollover. Or do I keep investing in my brokerage and only use the traditional IRA to facilitate the rollover? I've also maxed out the match on my company 401(k)  and not sure if that makes more sense to just invest in that over the match. 

I see a lot of information out there about the backdoor Roth and how to do it/liabilities/considerations/limits/rules but no how it plays into an overall larger retirement account strategy.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello, 
I’m expecting my income to be 130k or more this year, and feel I’m set to pay way too much income tax. I’m maxing out my 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, 529s for my two sons, and have $3000/year in capital gain losses, but still expect to pay over 10% of my income in state and federal income taxes. 

I have ~40k in cash right now, and will have another 20k in 9 months or so. Are there any strategies I could deploy with this cash to shave off a few thousand extra in income taxes?

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all, 

This is hopefully not a dumb question, but I’ve recently been accepted to veterinary school as a non-trad student  (28) and faced with borrowing a mountain of student loans for the next four years. I have a Roth but with very little contributions thus far. My question is - can I use my student loan allotment to max out my Roth for the next four years and would it even be worth it for the additional ~25000 or so in loans I’d have to pay back. Or should I wait until working after graduation to start making contributions? I figure i’ll be paying back these loans for the next foreseeable forever as it is, so at least i’d have the Roth working for me in the meantime?

While you may be thinking ya no shit or yes welcome to generational wealth and privilege, when I graduated college I was stunned at the amount of friends and peers I had whose parents payed for their rent/a portion of their rent. And yes while many of these peers moved to NYC and Boston, I was shocked at these peers moving to luxury buildings, living without roommates, or just outright not even attempting to live below their means. 

I understand fully too if you are a parent and you have worked hard and want to give back to your children, by no means I totally understand that but at what point does financially helping and assisting your children hurt them per se. I feel like by the time you graduate it’s time to be supporting yourself on your own to the best you can or at least be taking steps to work towards supporting yourself on your own.

For example, I live in Boston which is the second most expensive city in America to live in. I live in an apartment with no air condition, three floor walk up, no laundry in unit, no dishwasher and a 40 minute commute to work by train .I live with a roommate, but our apartment is very large and we feel safe and it’s all we need is a 23-year-olds just starting out in their career, trying to save money and gain financial independence. I would have never even considered, asking my parents to pay for my rent. while I did graduate college with a job and no debt I only looked at apartments that were well within my means.

When I had graduated from college, I was stunned by how many of my friends and peers had their parents paying their rent. They were living luxury buildings, and in high rent districts for their respective cities. No one considered moving home or just out right not living in a city that was too expensive for what your salary was. I feel like so many parents still help out their children and enable them to never live below their means or learn budgeting and its not talked about.

Sorry this might be a bit long

I recently bought a used 2007 Honda accord and now I have to pay around 500 to replace the starter because it’s end has been reached. 

Originally the car was meant for me and my sister to share, with her using it more since I’m away at college and can’t bring a car since I’m a freshman. 

I also got a refund check from my university for my scholarship and I’m thinking I might buy another used car for me and give my sister the Accord. 

I’m not sure how to go about this cause I could just sell the Accord and get a slightly newer car. At the same time I want a car that I don’t have to share cause in the fall I’m taking my car to campus. I don’t want to just take the car from my sister and have her resort to Ubers with weirdos again.

I don’t want to make the wrong decision cause maybe I could save the money and put some of it into the Accord.

FinancialPlanning,"I have $121,000 in student loan debt and I am a co-signer to my wife’s student loan debt as well which is $54,000 for a total of $175,000. Both loans accrue at 5.375%. I have been aggressively paying down my loan over the last year by paying an additional $3,000 in principal per month. All-in we are paying $5,000 per month on both loans with the extra principal payment included in that payment. 

I have $210,000 in our checking account. Given the inflationary environment (and the fact that these aren’t low low rates at 5.375%) I think it makes sense to pay off about 90% of this debt instead of keeping it in my account.  My thinking is that once I pay off the majority of these loans I can start freeing up cash for investment. 

I have no other investments other than making out my 401K and our mortgaged home.

FinancialPlanning,"Married, 30 years old, together we have a take home of 130-135k/year. My personal expenditure per month for bills is around 1100$. In half we make around 65-67/year base income each, with overtime that is available I made 100k this past year for 22', with her making 94k. For the foreseeable future the overtime will still be available for the next few years to come.

My question is this, is it worth it to buy new car that is 41-43k new, but would be the car I drive into the ground? My current vehicle is a 2018 hyundai with 72k miles, with 3 years till it is payed off (owe 12k). I put alot of miles on it in a short time due to going to school/work. We managed to buy a home in beginning of this crazy market and got lucky, and we now only drive 5 miles to and from work daily (3x a week) after graduating and having a job that is close to home. I have 54k currently saved in the bank (quite literally doing nothing with it, not smart, I know).

I have no debt besides the car (303/month), house (650/month), cell phone (67$/month) and 1600$ on a rooms to go credit card that is interest free for 5 years (4 years remaining) and can pay that off when I choose. I have had a few things go wrong with this car that was not covered under warranty, putting me out 5k to date (water pump and things alike) as it happened after the 60k mile mark. This makes me anxious knowing that these issues \*could\* continue to happen until my full warranty is up at 100k/miles.

FinancialPlanning,"Married (27) with 2 young kids. We have maxed my 401k (with a 9% match) and both of our Roth IRAs for the last 3 years. Maxed Roth accounts, but no 401k the year before that. We currently have $115,000 in retirement savings and another $50,000 in a taxable account. We currently invest $3,500 a month into retirement accounts, including my company match. We still save an additional $1,500+ a month into taxable accounts on top of this. 

I was running numbers on a compound interest calculator today, and as it stands, if we continue investing $3500 a month into retirement accounts until 35 (8 years) we will have $726,000 in 401k and Roth accounts. This is assuming a 10% return non inflation adjusted. We are invested 100% in S&amp;P 500 ETFs, which have averaged 13% non inflation adjusted the last 10 years. 

We live in a low cost of living part of the country. We grew up here, have decent jobs and don’t plan to move. My thought is - would it be a viable financial plan to knock down contributions to just my company match at 35 and max Roth IRA, so we can allocate the rest of that money towards taxable investments, rental properties etc.? Contributing to company match and maxing Roth accounts alone still puts us at over $2,000 per month going to retirement accounts. 

If we assume the same 10% rate of return referenced above and the 726,000 figure is accurate, we could not put another dime in retirement and at 55 it would be compounded to almost 5 million.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello, I make 85k per year in California. I am 22 years old, and have ~20k in Robinhood investments, ~20k in Marcus high yield savings, and ~5k in my checking account. I am contributing to a 401k but not an IRA.

I live with my parents and pay for a state college education out of pocket (will be about 20k to finish my Bachelor's in computer science in the next 3 years part time).

I was thinking I'd put a decent portion (75%?) Of my savings into a high yield CD account since it's unlikely I will need all the funds.

I am putting 30% of my money into bills, 20% into everyday expenses, and 50% into savings.

FinancialPlanning,"I have a large amount of personal credit card debt, student loan debt, and failed business debt with which I am having to contend. I had been using the ""Stash"" app to start investing for some time now and have amassed a little over 10K in that account.

My question is should I sell off the stock that I have now and use that 10K to pay off debts? Maybe sell off half of it to shave off some of the debt?

FinancialPlanning,"So I have good news and bad news. The good news is I got promoted at my job (I do Cyber Security now) after working for my current company for a year, I make a lot more than I used to. 

The bad news is the job is out of state and as the true cost of the move is revealed it’s not as affordable as once thought, even with the relocation stipend. I am short about 6k. The shortage comes from the costs of early termination and deposits.

That brings me to the loan part. I have bad credit, a little over a ago I had no job (lost during pandemic, I tried for 2 years) and worked my way from temping as an usher, to finishing my degree and here I am. While unemployed the bills stacked up and my credit went from Good to Poor. I am having a hard time securing a loan.

My total gross now is around $115k. I have paystubs with my new rate. I just got told my new income is not relevant and they based the loan decision off my old pay rate (a 30k difference) not what is reflected on my pay stubs currently. They also over inflated my VA pay by a fair margins almost 10k (while in my favor, this is also not correct) I got told basically I lied on the application and can’t reapply for another month. I can’t wait that long to relocate.

Can I get some baseline truth on how lenders calculate income?

FinancialPlanning,"I’m a 28 year old male making roughly $96K per year. Currently married with no children and no plans on having children in the future.

I have always wanted/ not had a performance car and I am head over heels in love with the C8 corvette. I want to get one within the next year or two because it’s been reported the ‘Corvette’ will become its own brand in 2025 and won’t have a two seater V8 anymore. Buying another type of performance vehicle is not a choice at this time due to preference and buying a used C8 is just as expensive as new at MSRP, which I’ve been able to find.

My current take home monthly pay is around $5600 after putting 7% toward 401K and including taxes.

My current monthly expenses are mortgage/ utilities of $800-850 (wife and I split the housing bills) student loans of 135 that last one more year, and 50 on car insurance for my daily driver that’s paid off. I’m putting 400 into my Roth every month and 1700 into liquid savings. Which leaves me with 2465 (I’m putting 2700 into savings now but would take this out for car payment). I usually spend about 500 or so per month at most on other things such as groceries entertainment etc.

My plan would be to save hard over this time period for the down payment. I currently have 10K in liquid savings and aim to have at minimum 30K in my savings account so I can put down 15-20K on a roughly $75K out the door corvette. Monthly payments would either be 1250 over 48 months or 1000 across 60 (I did factor in 4% apr as I have a credit score of ~800)

I’m fully aware that this isn’t the “smartest” decision but wanted to get thoughts on the level of how much I can afford this as I don’t spend my money often on other parts of my life and want to make sure I’ve thought this through before committing.

I’m obviously going to need to cut my shopping but I’m trying to figure out if there is one or two things I should focus on now vs attending to many things.

My fixed expenses are $4.5k/month including mortgage/hoa/tax
I don’t drive a car

$100k in my 401k (I currently contribute 10% to my 401k)
$45k in my brokerage account that I don’t really pay attention to
$18k in my Roth IRA (recently started maxing this out each year)
$25k in high yield savings

$115k in debt to my parents for helping me partially with my property (I pay them $1.5k/month)
No student debt
~2-3k in credit card debt each month (yikes)

Besides limiting expenses each month, I figure I should take out all my money in the brokerage and give it to my parents towards their debt but I’m not sure if I’m thinking about the priority correctly because I’m worried about my savings.

FinancialPlanning,"I have a 403b plan through my old employer. There is approx $1500 in the account. I work part time now so I do not have another retirement account through my employer. 

Ideally, I’d like to pull it out and use the money towards my tuition for college. I’m just curious if that is the correct decision. I am not educated about financial things related to retirement so any input is helpful. 

I was told my options were to move it to a Roth account (not sure what that is and I’m certain that I do not have one), leave it where it is with no penalty, or cash it out and face penalty of 10%, plus federal and state taxes. 

I spoke to the retirement company today, and they said they would withhold federal taxes, and the state that I live in has an “estimated” tax of 0% at this time. The 10% penalty would be due during tax season.

FinancialPlanning,"This summer my bf and I plan on buying a home and moving in together. I currently own a home and he rents. I am estimating that my home will be worth $145-150k when I sell it, and that amount will then go into whatever loan we get for the new place (which will be bigger and, likely more expensive). 

My bf and I are going to have an in-depth conversation about our finances, and I hope to speak with a financial advisor soon as well. We'll most likely draw up some kind of Cohabitation Agreement. However, I'm nervous about tax implications depending on how we proceed and the fact that I have more stake in our future home since I already have the loan on my current home which will go towards the new buy.

 My bf wants us both on the loan and the deed to the house, but I'm unsure if that's best for me financially (I obviously want to take his finances and opinions into account, but I also need to look out for my own finances in the event that things end badly).

Sorry for the long explanation, but I guess my main questions are: 
- What would be the best way to get the loan and to title the house in our situation?
-Are there any tax implications that arise from buying/deeding the home in a certain way outside of ordinary tax stuff?
-Any advice or stories from anyone who has been in this situation before?

Backstory: I (31m) have been living on my own since beginning of 2019. I lived in a 1 bed/bath duplex in a moderate cost of living city in CA. Rent was $1000/month and I was making $50k at the time. I lived in that duplex until October 2021 (rent was raised to $1100 at this point) and then moved into a 3 bed/2 bath house, just by myself. Rent was $1575. I lived there for 7 months and then decided to downsize and moved in with my brother, renting a room in his house in June 2022 (currently paying $600 + internet only. Him and my sister in law take care of all other bills). I'm still living with my brother, but I do miss living alone. When I first moved in with my brother, I was able to pay off my car loan and now own my car outright. 

Present: I've been living with him for 7 months now, and there are really no issues, but I do feel like besides my bedroom and the guest/ hall bathroom, I don't really have my own space. I did find a 1 bed/bath for $1200/month, which is considered a good deal and it's in a very active part of the downtown area in my city. I'm debating moving again (3rd time in 2 years). I work from home 80% of the time so I spend about 18-20 hours of my day in my bedroom since my work station is also in my bedroom. I don't use the living room at all and eat in the kitchen/dining area about once a week. 

As for debt, I have no big debt since I paid off my car loan last year (nothing wrong with it mechanically and it's less than 10 years old) and my income is now $70k. So if I move out, I'll be saving less money than I would living with my brother, but I'll still be saving money. I am on a phone plan with the same brother I live with and including the phone payment and plan, it's about $100/month. I have a few grand in savings, bit haven't been able to save the last few months due to holidays. I can easily save $1k+ a month now that the holidays are over (even if I move out). I'm also putting away an extra $600/month into a 457b retirement account on top of the mandatory deductions from my paycheck for retirement through my employer. 

I do prefer to live alone and I have no issues living alone since I've been on my own since 2019. My goal was to save to buy a house, but I am in no rush to buy one and can still save to eventually buy one. I'm also single and have no kids, and don't plan to make any major purchases soon. I would be moving our family dog to live with me as well since my parents are getting old and cannot take care of her as much (she's a bully and weighs about 70-80 lbs). 

This is longer than expected. I'm just trying to see if living alone again is a good idea or if I should stay with my brother. If I do continue to stay with my brother, I would only stay about another year max. If I forget anything or if you need more information, please let me know. 

Tl;Dr: currently living with my brother paying $700/month rent, but I essentially live out of my bedroom only. Looking to move to a 1 bed/bath apartment for $1200 a good idea? I will still be saving money either way and will have more space for me since I work from home as well.",t2_190h376,0,Continue to live with brother or move out?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,1096ift,True,ix3ph09,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1096ift/continue_to_live_with_brother_or_move_out/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1096ift/continue_to_live_with_brother_or_move_out/,508849,1673448581,0,,False,1673448596,1673448597,2023-01-11 14:49:41,,,,,,
FinancialPlanning,"My boyfriend and I, both mid 30s, have a decision to make of who moves where. I feel like there are pros and cons for all available options and I'm not sure what is the best route to take.

Current situation: My boyfriend lives in Chicago and is in federal law enforcement. His current salary is $80k but he will work his way up to $140k in about five years. He cannot leave Chicago for another 4 years in this current role. I live in a low cost of living city with total compensation of $160k a year. I am geographically limited on where I can work because I have a PhD in a niche field. The cost of living calculator shows Chicago is 30% more expensive than where I life. We want to be together.

CHICAGO OPTION: My boyfriend stays in his current job. He makes $80k a year this year and I take a job making $115k. Total compensation between us is $195k immediately. Based on salary ranges from the lab I'd be working for, I expect in 5 years I'd be making $130k and he'd make $140k. Total compensation is $270k. Downside is my career, giving up being a lead researcher to support staff since there's nothing in the area that's in my area of research.

LOWER COL OPTION: I stay at my current job at $160k a year. He takes a job at the local police department making $70k a year. Total compensation is $230k. In 5 years, I anticipate my total compensation would be around $175k a year, but his would be capped out at $70k. Total between us would be $245k. Downside is his income being capped out and he'd be working a crappy schedule for a while until he gained seniority.

I'm expected to progress to the next stage of my the program in a few months, during which my annual salary is 60k. I currently have a 46k investment portfolio (lost about 20% of its value in the past 18 months), a 5k Roth ira, $400 HYSA and my checking is almost consistently below $100. Until recently, 60% of my income would go straight into my portfolio and the remaining 40% would cover my everyday expenses.   


However this is my current breakdown of how my income is allocated: 

|Investment portfolio|42%|
|:-|:-|
|Roth IRA |15%|
|High Yield Savings Account |13%|
|Checking account  (spending money)|30%|

I do have a Roth 401k with my job however, they dont start matching contributions until I have worked at the company for 1 year so I wont be contributing until then.  

My only fixed expenses are for gas, phone bill, and a few streaming subscription that total around just $300/mo.  After including my expenses for dining out, and misc. purchases, my total avg monthly expense is typically between $700-900. 

Is there anything I can do, or a more efficient way to allocate my income to make the most of it?

Despite consistently contributing to my portfolio and my Roth ira on a biweekly basis it appears that I have been stuck around the 50k net worth mark for nearly a year now.

FinancialPlanning,"Basic Information

I am 22, turning 23 this spring. I have a bachelors degree and I'm currently working in the Aviation industry.

Income + Existing Contributions

I currently net about $3,300 per month, rounding to $1650 per paycheck. I currently contribute 5% to my Roth 401(k), as I do not get a match my first year of employment. Once I hit one year of service at the company, if I contribute 9% I get a 6% match which is what I plan on doing. I also have an existing Roth IRA, which is not funded yet.

Expenses

I currently live at home with my parents (rent-free) and I pay off my credit cards in full each month which amount to around $600-700 each month. My car is also paid off.

Debts

As previously stated, I don't carry any credit card debt, auto, or any other debt other than student loans.

Currently my student loans are as follows:

$32,220.12 @ 4.40% - Federal DoE Unsubsidized Loan

$63,661.64 @ 5.22% - Private Loan

The Federal Loan is not currently accruing interest nor are payments due, however, the private loan carries a minimum payment every month of around $730. I currently pay $2000 a month just to accelerate the payoff due to the large balance.

Savings and Emergency Fund

I currently have around $7,500 in a savings account as an emergency fund. I know this is relatively low but it can easily cover six months of my expenses.

Questions

What is the best course of action? I would like to be debt-free, but also fund my retirement accounts and possibly save for a house so I can move out of my parents house. I am very fortunate for the situation I am in, as my expenses are minimal. I know that tomorrow is not promised but my earning potential is astronomical, as I should be making 110K+ at the beginning of 2024. I just feel lost as to where I should put my money.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello. I'm a 19-year-old, full-time college student who is currently unemployed and has been for about the past 2 months, but my previous job paid approximately $21/hr, and the job I am currently looking for pays exactly that same amount. I anticipate to be in said job by March, if not earlier. That being said, here has been my budget for the past 2 months I have been unemployed. 

I drive quite frequently to visit my boyfriend, who lives 30 miles away from home. To split it evenly, I drive down to him about as much as he drives down to me. I spend about $25 on gas for myself a week. I also spend about $25 as a combo between eating out and occasional splurges on stuff I like (usually crystals, books, or board/videogames). I used to spend quite a bit more while I was employed, but I'm trying to cut it down, but still have a decent amount of comfort. As such, I spend about $50/week and $200/month on myself. I have about $8,000 left in both checking and savings combined, $2,000 of which I have in a money market account. So far, those in my personal life whom I've asked say I'm doing amazingly, but they don't exactly have the greatest track record when it comes to good finances.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi everyone, I wanted to get your take on this since I value everyone’s advice on this forum. 

A couple years ago, my sister opened up 529s for each of my kids. I think they’re through Fidelity. She wants me to be putting money into that account too, and even mentioned having other family members do the same. 

I appreciate her thoughtfulness; however, I know for sure she is not very financially stable and I’m worried about the safety of the money. She is obviously the account owner so she will have control of the money, so I’m worried she may withdraw it if she is ever in a financial bind. I wish I could trust her more but I can’t. Should I just open 529s separately and contribute to those instead? Talking to my sister about my concerns could cause a huge rift.

I know through insurance it will be considered a rental house. But after researching, should I look into a LLC? From whom is the best to get advise? (CPA, financial planner, estate lawyer?).

FinancialPlanning,"

38 years old. $34k in debt, excluding car payment. I have a great job and make just under 100k a year. I live week to week. Under $800 in savings. We're a family of 6. My wife doesn't work due to health reasons. I feel like I'm drowning. Previous bankruptcy in 2018 due to a divorce. Bought a house in 2020 with an FHA loan. Switched jobs a year ago and it was a paycut for the first 6 months. 

Not sure if I should refinance my mortgage and take out the equity to pay off my debts. Rates have obviously gone up. Looked into heloc briefly but in all honesty all of this is stressful and confusing. 

Current mortgage is $1700. Currently paying almost $1400 on minimum debt payments. Honestly, when I break it down like that it seems like a no brainer but my home is really the only thing I have and I don't want to screw myself in the long run either. 

My mortgage company is offering a refinance at these specs: 

30 year
$2318
5.625 % (up from 2.75%)
6.772% apr (this I'm confused on)

1m purchase price, 750k mortgage.

4.625% 10/6ARM no points, locked at the moment. But if we pay $20000 we buy it down to 3.75% on a 30y fixed. We're able to do this since we paid a locking fee. Option I'm not considering : 4.825% 0 points 30y fixed. 

The breakeven from the monthly savings if we pay the points is at about month 52 into the payments. 

We have 70k in emergency savings after moving in and this 20k was earmarked for a new vehicle which we'll skip at this time for another year or so till we save up again, if we end up buying points. Possibly a baby on the way too so there's the day care money. HCOL area. 

Options I'm mulling through 
1. Borrow 20k less but that only reduces the monthly payment by about $100. Also need to stay in the Jumbo loan category. 
2. Borrow at 4.625% and use the 20k towards the principle and recast the mortgage once we figure out a few things in the new home.

FinancialPlanning,"Need advice on next steps! Bank essentially stole our money. I mean probably not really, but we need it back and they won’t give it back. 

Here’s the rundown: 
- Fiancé and I both have individual savings accounts with Marcus by Goldman Sachs. We created a joint high yield savings account with BrioDirect, a division of Webster Bank with the goal of consolidating our savings. Attempted to transfer $ from Marcus to Brio using Brio’s platform on 12/2/22.
- Brio locked and then subsequently closed our account. The reason is still unclear, but that’s not actually the problem 
- My money returned to my Marcus account immediately. My fiancé has over $8,000 that was never returned to his Marcus account. It’s been over a month. We’ve been calling and calling- talking to representatives and supervisors from both banks
- Marcus consistently gives us the same answer. They’re very sorry but because a) transfer was initiated on Brios end b) accounts weren’t actually linked on Marcus’ end and c) there isn’t an account anymore at Brio, there’s not a whole lot they can do. They’ve been very kind and have even spoken to Brio’s supervisors in a 3 way call to try to get answers. No luck. 
- Brio representatives and supervisors have given me different answers every single time we have called. I have followed each and every piece of advice, I have waited the periods of time they have told me to wait, I have jumped through every hoop. None of it has worked and they truly have no idea. They’ve also been quite rude and condescending. 
- Today a Brio supervisor told me so many conflicting pieces of information in the same phone call: the money entered into the account and days later it was locked and then closed, the money never made it into the account because the account was closed and automatically bounced back to Marcus so it was their problem, and appallingly enough he had “no idea” where our money was or if it was at the institution. He also told me that there was nobody else I could talk to and in different words essentially I was shit out of luck. I was also told our account was closed due to insufficient funds (ie they never accepted the money), and that he couldn’t disclose why the account was closed. Previously I had been told fraud concerns. We may never know. 
- the latest info is that Brio has sent Marcus correspondence asking them to confirm that the account is open and valid. One person gave me fax info saying Brio faxed Marcus- Marcus says they don’t do faxing for bank account confirmations, they only do it over the phone. Brio says they only do fax. One lady said that if Brio doesn’t hear from Marcus the money will automatically go back to Marcus within 30 days. I told her it had been over 30 days and she said “oh well it could be 60”. She’s the first to relay that but of info so honestly I don’t exactly believe it.

I recently rolled over my previous employers ESOP balance into a traditional rollover IRA at Vanguard. I am just curious as to if it’s better to keep contributing to that for the future, or just keep that open and start a Roth IRA and start putting money into that instead.

FinancialPlanning,"I am newly graduated engineer making almost $72,000 in Florida. I currently have about $11,500 saved (aiming for $3k/month) in a couple HYSA after working for 6 months. My main goal at the moment is to buy (save for) a house and am saving as much as I can as I still live with my parents. 

At the same time, I am not making any contributions to a 401k (i don’t believe) and I do not have a Roth IRA set up.

I have spent about $4,000 in the last 5 months on repairs to my car - granted I do not currently make any payments on it.

She’s got 130k miles on her and I expect her to push 250k as I maintain her as best I can.

At 24, I’m dying to move out to start my life but I am really prioritizing being financially comfortable for when that moment comes.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi! My question is simply-to save or not to save?
It seems simple, or so I thought.
For context, I do not live in the USA. I live in EU, where my medical insurance and pension are covered in full by the state (provided i stay employed). 
I earn cca 1.300 EUR net/month, which is very average in my country, but in reality doesnt leave much wiggle room (just for context, an average one bedroom apt rent is 700eur).
However, I was lucky enough to not have to worry about housing or car, got it gifted to me, so have very little monthly expenses (cca 200eur).
I am single with a small dog. I dont plan on having kids.

Up until now I was saving rigirously. I managed to save up almost 20.000 in the last 5 years (mind you, my income used to be a lot smaller, I got promoted 3months ago).
I was always the ‘safe’ type so i tried saving as much as possible.
I understand I need to have some savings to cover unpredictable expenses and I CAN save some money, I dont NEED all that much.
However, lately I have been thinking about whats the point and what rly matters.

If I continue saving I might, best case scenario, have cca 150.000 EUR in my avcount by the time im 50YO. That is not enough to retire (I absolutely hate working), not enough to buy real estate (prices for a decent flat start at around 500.000 here), not rly enough for anything. Yes I could invest I know, but I am just not savy in that area and Im not a risk taker, so that is not going to happen.

I thought I will be married and we will buy our own place by now, but since I have hit 30, am an overweight introvert and I dont rly like people all that much that seems less and less likely to happen. 

Meanwhile, time flies by. Im living on a relatively tight budget, whereas if I wouldnt be saving regularly ( just occasionally) I could go on some rly great vacation every year. I could buy some nice clothes. I could travel and have more experiences, maybe I woudl actually meet new people. I could go to that dance class that I have been thinking about for the last 3 years. I could live the best life possible.

I am not the healthiest, dont have good family history, battle with depression and already find little enjoyment in life. I always felt like i wouldnt live to be past 60 amyway (all my grandaprents went from cancer before60).

Again, I am not talking living payckech to paycheck or getting into debt, I will always have at least those 20.000 to fall back on, i dont have many expenses and as said we have free healthcare and dont rly have tornadoes floods etc. i am also fortunate enough to have a well off family (in case of a life or death emergency) so i dont think i will every rly need more.

So, I'm in quite a bit of credit card debt and have no savings. I make a good salary ($3k per month after taxes) and I have about $1000 after expenses, so it's not as though I'm unable to pay off debt or save. But I just can't motivate myself to. I have a budget all figured out, but in the moment, I just really want that Taco Bell, I really want that pretty journal I don't need, I really want X, Y and Z. I can sit down and think, you know, ""I want to save to visit my family in France, I want to save for a car, I want to pay off my debt so I don't have to make these damn payments while I'm (hopefully) pursuing my PhD next year,"" etc. etc., but it all goes out the window in the moment, when that shiny thing is sitting there.

For those of you who experience the urge to buy but don't act on it--what do you do? How do you manage that? Do you distract yourself, or remind yourself of your goals? Or maybe it's a holistic thing, where I just need to fill my life with more time with friends and activities and such so I'm not sitting on my computer looking at Amazon? Haha.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello. I'm not sure if this is the place to be asking this, but I'll ask anyway. What do I have to lose right? Just wanting some other opinions. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I have several old 401k accounts from jobs when I was younger. There are three total. My current job also has a 401k that I'm contributing to. However, I don't like the withdraw rules (etc) on this current 401k with my employer. I contribute to it because they match each contribution up to a certain %, which seems like a pretty good deal. The withdraw rules I'm talking about are basically when you're allowed to pull funds. It's basically once you no longer work for the company, or in some other rare cases. If I needed money for medical expenses, that wouldn't be covered.  

&amp;nbsp;

So, I'm thinking that I should take the three old accounts and open a new 401k with my main bank. That way one it's all consolidated in one place (other than the active one with my current employer), two I can easily see the balance, three I can contribute to it easily if I choose to, four I'm assuming the rules on with draws will be more relaxed for emergencies. 

&amp;nbsp;

i'm still living at home with my family and am really really hoping to move out at the very least sometime this year. the biggest hangup of mine rn is my $2700 of cc debt that i racked up over the last two years. i started smart in March 2021 with a secured card but i got too comfortable and now i have three cards that are maxed. I've never missed a minimum payment at least so if i can get out of this debt i will be in very good shape. 

hours are rough at work rn sadly but a typical month of income for me is around $1600-1800. i have zero obligations and theoretically i could just not spend a good chunk of money over a couple months and boom it would be taken care of and i can lock those pesky things away and never touch them unless i absolutely need them. 

the biggest issue is that i can't commit to payments that are like a good chunk of my checks cause my parents always end up needing help with something. but by the time they need help i will have been empty and then i end up using my credit card to help them and the cycle just keeps going like that. they're not horribly poor they get paid fairly well now, they just unfortunately had 5 kids in their 20s they couldn't afford and the consequences are still haunting them to this day. 

i don't mind helping them cause they do let me live w them rent free and have let me be very irresponsible these past few years but it's getting to be so draining emotionally. i'm not that person anymore and i'm ready to buckle down and start my life but i don't know how to break out of this.",t2_vgkapgin,0,cc debt and parents who keep needing my help,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,106l4bg,True,cleoemari,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/106l4bg/cc_debt_and_parents_who_keep_needing_my_help/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/106l4bg/cc_debt_and_parents_who_keep_needing_my_help/,506110,1673189752,0,,False,1673189764,1673189764,2023-01-08 14:55:52,,,,,,
FinancialPlanning,"My father just cut me off yesterday. 

I'm not mad about it. I'm on my final semester of college and was already planning out a budget and spending plan for when I graduate, this just came a few months early. If anything, I'm angrier about why it happened, and the emotions around it but that's another story.

The weirdest thing though, is that after the shell shock from hiss anger and everything that happened, I woke up this morning and I feel almost... relieved?

I've been wanting to be financially independent from my parents and trying to figure out how to do that without their help. Ive been wanting to be independent and away from them for so long but I was kind of afraid they'd feel hurt because I know once I'm no longer in their grasp, I might just never come back. This kind of gave me a better excuse to let them go than the ""i just don't like you that much.""

Maybe I sound like a spoiled brat, idk. I won't go so far as to say my parents are bad parents/people, i don't think that. There's just a lot of very different personalities in this family and I'm tired of being hurt because of the way I am. I'm really thankful for my friends because they keep me grounded and help me to feel like it isn't all in my head.

There's a lot going on in their lives right now too, so tensions are high at home.

again, they aren't bad parents, just bad at understanding their kids and i thought things had been getting better these past few years all to come crumbling down this new year.

Many teachers have been known to retire with well over a million dollars because they contributed to the TDA. There are drawbacks to the TDA like you can't take out money until you're 59 but a good thing is that you can always borrow against your balance in case you need to buy a house or something like that.

Currently I am contributing $874 dollars per month into the TDA which helps lower my taxable income. The problem is that I don't want to retire when I am 59, that seems like an eternity away. I want to retire when I am 35-40. I am currently living at home so i am trying to save as much as I could into my HYSA and am putting some money into peer lending like prosper, I have also been putting $1,000 per month into stocks and long term growth dividend stocks such as VOO and SCHD. 

I was wondering if I should stop contributing to the TDA and use that money to make investments in the short term or if I should leave it in there.

Was also wondering If you guys had any other financial advice for me.

FinancialPlanning,"So I'll try to make this as succinct as possible:

July 2021 I purchased (financed...I know, I know) a luxury vehicle (BMW). It was a 2015 model with only 20k miles and was in great condition. I earned slightly upwards of 110K the last 2 years, intend on doing so for the next few, and my monthly payments/car expenses are within means.

**I've made questionable financial decisions in the last few years and so my savings only total $5k currently, but I can save around $2-2.5K a month comfortably now.**

The problem is, I commute way more than I calculated for work (NJ/NY/PA area) and I've managed to accrue 37k miles in only a year and a half (24k mi/yr avearge). I've been diligent on routine maintenance and between that and tire expenses (big rims + low profile + potholes = bubbles), I've spent about $8.1k in maintenance so far. I love the car and how it drives, but it was a **terrible** choice for a daily driver, especially for my high milage commuting.

I still owe $29.7k on the vehicle and trade in/sale estimates are around $18.5k for what it's worth. I want to sell/trade it for something that can keep up with my mileage (toyota/lexus) with decent options and milage, but the market for used cars is crazy and even a 4-5yr old Toyota Rav 4 can easily run close to $30K. The BMW is currently at 57K miles and I'll expect to be performing significant maintenance repairs this year based on my milage.

I don't have much money for a down payment, and my credit score is around 730. I would sacrifice a higher monthly payment for a 36-48month loan term (max 10% APR), if it meant I could have peace of mind knowing my Toyota wouldn't **also** cost me $3-5k in repairs in the next year.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi everyone!

I’m trying to stick to a good budget so I can pay off some debt faster. I initially decided that I wanted to budget myself to spend $250 a week, including gas and groceries. However, it’s getting a lot harder than I thought because I’ll buy everything and not realize that I ran out of something like laundry detergent so thats another $20 spent. 

So I was wondering if I’m better off doing a monthly budget rather than trying to break down my weekly spending. For example, budgeting $400 to groceries a month, $50 to cleaning supplies (including laundry), $100 to activities, etc. On one hand, it makes it less stressful. On the other, putting a weekly budget makes me a lot more mindful of my spending throughout the week.

FinancialPlanning,"My individual brokerage is a mess of one-off stocks that I accumulated over the years. Most are not performing well and I want to simplify my portfolio.

I'm with Fidelity, so I believe the most simplest approach would be to utilize iShare ETFS in a basic 3 fund portfolio. From what I've read, Fidelity doesn't offer their own similar ETFs so iShare seems to be the way to go. I also believe ETFs in a taxable account are preferred over mutual funds, which I'd appreciate if someone could assure me that is accurate.

ETFS: ITOT, IXUS, and AGG.

Assuming I have the above correct, do I need to make this any more complicated than come Monday start selling off the current stocks (again mostly all drastically down) and then buying the 3 ETFs noted above? Is there a preferred method to doing something like this other then ""sell all old, buy all new""?

Since it's a taxable account I'm thinking the losses will be deductible come next tax season up to $3k (?) and then roll over until the losses are gone?

In addition to the above I plan to use SPAXX in my cash account to gain some additional interest for my uninvested cash.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello,

So I am beginning my Roth journey with a new retirement account on SoFi. I have a couple questions.

1. Is contributing funds after receiving my paycheck the way to do it? At first glance it seems this results in being double taxed. Once when paid,and again when contributing. In other words, what’s the best way to contribute?

2. Considering this, is it more wise to find a way to fund through paycheck deductions. I know this has a huge effect on HSA contributions. (I already am matching my employer into a 403b but I don’t think Roth is offered)

3. When does taxation occur? Does this taxation occur during yearly taxes when reporting contributions?

4. Does it really matter who hosts the Roth IRA if there is zero commission fees. I would like to keep everything as streamlined as possible.

5. Lastly, is it wise to roll my regular IRA into my Roth to consolidate and maximize 2022 contributions?

FinancialPlanning,"Im a 25yo with 23k in credit card debt. 

I have many responsibilities and people to look after for, im going though a nightmare divorce and was living in hotels for some months until one of my friends rented me a room in his apartment. I need to get rid of one of my cars and lower my credit card payments. I don’t want to close my American Express Business credit cards but all the other ones can go. What would be the smartest way to go about my current situation? Im genuinely under water at the moment. Than you and have a great day!

My monthly expenses
 
My rent 900$

My Kids rent 400+ utilities(in Puerto Rico)

Private school 200$

Chase cards 260$ and 210$ owed a total of around 16k

Amex non business 110$, 100$ and 90$ total of 3.5k 

Car payments 234$ and 340$ (trying to get rid of the higher payment one) one owes 8k the other one owes 12k

Discover 98$ total of 1.5k

Car insurance i haven’t even paid it so they canceled it but 340$ 

Phone service 40$

Loan 380$ owes 13k

2 other desperate loans 180$ and 150$ total 6k

Gas money 27$ weekly 

So around 3,700$

Interest rates vary from 18% to 22% on the credit cards 
2% and 7% on the cars
10% on the big loan 
The smaller loans are death loans at 60%

I eat for free at work and i usually only eat once a day.

She takes care of groceries for the kids.

My business cards run solid because at the moment i just brake even, they are charge cards. BUT i currently owe 2k that is going to get paid off at the end of the month.

I currently make 1,600 biweekly as a Food and beverage supervisor in Marriott, i got a security part time but i don’t start till end of next week. 

I want to pay some of this off so i can focus on my business that has paid handsomely in the past and i was in good health financially. 

(Not that it matters) but i handle stressful situations very well and this time i thought it was going to be a dip in my life and i didn’t realize until 3 days ago that i am very deep in this scary whole lol 

I literally pay my rent with a credit card connected to PayPal and i supplement my bank account sending money out of PayPal from a credit card to a friend and him sending it back so i have it as regular balance to then transfer it to my bank account. 


So, i owe around 62k overall

the credit cards debt was in about 7 months.

I payed everything for them to sadly move out the country and all my savings plus credit cards were used.

FinancialPlanning,"Hey yall.

My fiancee and I want to start the home buying process in the next 6 months.

We live in Oregon and make a little under 90k a year before tax combined.

Our credit scores are 760 and 740, respectively.

We have 45k saved currently sitting in a money market at 3.3% return.

Our monthly debt payments are as follows:

Car loan 1 - 11k left, $280 a month. (4.8% rate)
Car loan 2 - 7k left, $220 a month (6.5% rate)

Credit card - $25 minimum (we don't pay the minimum but for dti's sake, it is $25)

Student loan combine - $50 (in forbearance)

We are looking at a soft cap of 280k and hard of 300k for house cost.

With the 45k, 5k will go to closing. I want to have at least 10k for savings.

This leaves us with 30k to put down. Our current credit union is offering 5.8% (6.04% apr).

I have a few questions.

First, should we refinance our cars to get the lowest payment possible? If we both refinanced for another 84 months, hers would be around $100 a month, and mine would be about $150. Making our total about $250. If we are to do this, how long does it take your credit score to bounce back up from the hard inquiry? We don't want it to impact our chances of a mortgage.

Second, should we put the entire 30k down? Or just the minimum 3%?

Third, do you think this price limit for a house considering our down payment and DTI, respectable?

I heard it's smarter to put the minimum 3% at closing and then the rest after the first few months. (This seems kinda off advice).
