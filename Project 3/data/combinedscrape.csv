Low 50's DINK's

Wife and I have been employed since high school. Once I'm done, I have zero desire to work ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 22 years with current company and my wife has 10. No kids.

&amp;#x200B;

Lived in the same Midwest suburb for the last 23 years. We've lived 15 years in this house and it will be paid off in 2. Paid $240k for it new in 2008 (before housing crash). It's worth about $400k now. No other debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope to retire in 7 years. If we can get about an 8% return over the next 7 years, I'll be right where I want to be. About 30% of my retirement funds are in Roth vehicles. Should have about  40k in an HSA, which should help us bridge the 5 year gap until Medicare. I have a very small pension that's not even worth mentioning. It use to be worth mentioning but my company has torn it to shreds over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

Really sick of the midwest winters and don't want to be snowbirds. Once we retire, plan on buying a house in the desert SW. We've checked out a number of places on vacation. May consider a 55+ community but have some reservations on that plan.",retirement,"Your current status and your future wishes for retirement I'll start

6,How does retirement cash flow from 401k actually work?,"Okay, so this may seem like a silly question, but consider me completely uninformed regarding retirement and cash flow.  I will provide a little bit of my situation for context.  I am 52 and married.  The wife is 52 as well.  I have a retirement plan at work and I contribute the maximum allowed and my employer matches up to 6%.  Current balance is about 500k and the calculators I've used suggest I should have around 2 million at 65.  I am eligible for social security as well (about 3300 if I start at 67, or 2800 if at 65).

The wife has a pension (she is a teacher) that will pay her a little over 3k if she retired today.  At the end of the year she will be fully vested and also qualify for lifetime health insurance for the both of us (for her life, not mine).  She also has a retirement plan with about 65k and started maxing it about six months ago.  No matching.  Finally, we live in southern CA and how will be paid off in 2035 (when we both turn 65).

Anyway, here is dumb question.  Assuming we have well over 2 million in our retirement plans, how does cash flow actually work (especially if I delay social security)?  I mean, I get that we can purchase an annuity, though I imagine the return is smaller and perhaps not the wisest choice if we also want to leave something for the kids.  

But what about keeping the money invested in stocks?  I understand the idea of dividends but am not sure how that works re: cash flow.  And what happens when the market is down?  Like, over the past year my portfolio is down 6%.  What happens cash flow wise then?

Perhaps there is something else I don't know about options?",retirement,"How does retirement cash flow from 401k actually work?

7,W2 vs 1099? Last hurrah before retirement. Defer income?,"Based on prior input of deferring income …

https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/11hxw3b/deferring_job_income/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Looking at ~$125 / 145 per hr (W2/1099). Already worked almost 4 months at substantially less (W2) with accelerated Roth 401k contributions (almost half limit contributed). Job would be ending and wanted all the Roth I could get. 

W2 includes health ins (basic is free / not spouse). 401k match (4% match). Low value life ins / AD&amp;D. Couple others - minor. 

I’d be starting from scratch if 1099. Do I need an LLC or is sole proprietorship ok? Health insurance options (marketplace?) Wife’s Medicare starting Oct - I’m 1.5 years away. 

Wife kinda negative on 1099. Need accountant. Complex. But talked to financial guy. He says 1099. But admits I’m already carrying a lot of deferred comp from decades of trad 401k. But with recent mandatory withdrawals delayed - he’s ok. 

Also not sure what headache I’m getting into. Start in 8 business days - need to do quickly.

This contract is a year min. But I think it’s good chance just a year. So next year 4 months and rest might be retirement. So deferral not such an issue then.🤔

Would I rather have the cash and make Uncle Sam a little happier than he deserves?

Suggestions welcome! Virginia if it matters.",retirement,"W2 vs 1099? Last hurrah before retirement. Defer income? Based on prior input of deferring income …

8,Where to invest a large sum of money right now for someone who is 77+ years old?,"Long story short: my grandparents own the house next door to them and they’re in the process of selling it. They don’t have a financial planner and refuse to get one so they’re looking to me for advice on what to do with the money. 

They’re 87 and 77 years old, the older one’s health is declining. The younger one is doing great and will probably be around a while longer. 

My instinct is to invest it in a high yield CD while interest rates are high and put some in a HY savings account, as well as a mix of some treasuries/TIPS/I-bonds. They’ll need to access (some) of the money in the next couple years so want to stay away from longer-dated securities. 

I also am going to stay away from stocks since they’re older and the market is pretty uncertain right now. 

Any advice on where to put the money? I really don’t know their total expenses and other income (I’m going to try to find that out), but any general advice would be appreciated.",retirement,"Where to invest a large sum of money right now for someone who is 77+ years old?

So my dad's retirement age is 66 and 2 months. He is now 68 and 1 month. He did not start his benefits at retirement age because he was still working. At 67 and 8 months, he was laid off and since he hasn't been able to find anything else he has decided to apply for retirement. 

When filling out the application it says you can select to get benefits retroactively 6 months. 

I am trying to figure out what were his benefits 6 months prior to today and if it is worth applying for? There are no historical statements or records on the website to see what his prior benefits were. When I called SS the first person said he can apply up to 6 months prior to today and it WONT affect his benefit amount. The next person said he should apply only starting january of 2023, otherwise his benefits WILL be affected. 

Because he waited from the age of 66 to 68, he gets the delayed retirement credit.

36,A MEDITATION ON RETIREMENT,"Like a well-behaved, good-tempered infant, I adore mornings. I rise at dawn, eagerly make coffee, write essays, and listen to music. This morning, Mr. Chow, a jazz-pop song by Acoustic Alchemy, plays in the background. Outside, the harsh cold weather, the kind that distracts you, dissipates. Irregular patches of snow cover the backyard like an expressionist painting. With each year of not working, five and counting, distant memories of workplace drama and pressures - fade to black. Subsequently, scenes of dining with friends, early morning tennis matches, making pizza dough, and taking mid-day naps come into focus. 

Sometimes, I whisper under my breath, shit, this is my real life; I’m not dreaming. The first time I said that it was weirdly validating. My eyes misted; I exhaled slowly, feeling my blood pressure fall. I felt visceral gratitude. Ralph Waldo Emerson described it as vague, indefinite riches. No amount of material wealth buys humility and thankfulness. Since I have occasional archy joints after a challenging workout and poor sleep, I am joyful, almost smug, when I leave the bed and walk downstairs with clarity, comfort, and an erect carriage.

I recently watched a documentary, Stutz, featuring an inviting self-improvement practice -- the concept of life force. Parts of the strategy, like a good diet, exercise, and adequate sleep, are apparent. But the psychological steps of connection with others and introspection fascinate me, so I wanted to investigate.

According to Dr. Stutz, a psychotherapist, life force is your relationship to your physical body, other human beings, and yourself. Becoming your best self is possible when you do these things regularly:

• Eat nutritionally, exercise, and sleep. 
• Invite a friend or relative to lunch. 
• Write in a journal. 

Dr. Stutz believes these practices help you feel better all around. For instance, connection with others is a critical element of personal growth. The person you invite to lunch represents all of humanity. Relationships are like pitons, something you grab ahold for support and safety, as you climb the metaphorical mountain.

Of the three relationship components, the most important one is with yourself. People may think about what they want in life. But they rarely take a disciplined approach to writing down their thoughts. Accordingly, journaling is an effective way to explore what’s on your mind and discover your passions.

Journaling galvanized my desire to play better tennis. Other interests like reading classic books, craft cocktails, entertaining friends, and writing essays emerged. The former led to weekly tennis drills, weight training, cardio, lunches with fellow players, and culminating in the big Saturday morning match. What starts out as a serious competition with tennis balls hit with pace and loud grunts, eventually dissolves into ninety minutes of compliments, laughs, and high-fives. 

It sounds silly at sixty-eight, but I felt a renewed purpose with my tennis pursuits, an excitement for life in general. It wasn’t lost on me that if my retirement hobby were to play tennis at a competitive level, I wouldn’t offset it with a poor diet and lack of sleep. With a laissez-faire attitude, I focused on equal parts, winning, camaraderie, and fun. Not surprisingly, my tennis game improved so did the joy in my life.

As a sexagenarian, I learned something new from adopting Dr. Stutz’s life force practice. It’s called byproduct benefits. When I took one positive action, such as athletic training, several other things materialized - a healthier diet, better sleep, closer tennis friendships, and a more optimistic outlook. All in all, the life force isn’t rocket science, but it sure helped me enjoy my retirement even more. I hope you try it.",retirement,"A MEDITATION ON RETIREMENT Like a well-behaved, good-tempered infant, I adore mornings. I rise at dawn, eagerly make coffee, write essays, and listen to music.

70,Early retirement mistake,"I can't believe I left a golden handcuffs job. I worked in IT as a Software developer and project manager for 25 years in the state government. I've been wanting to quit the field entirely for at least the last 6-7 years, but I convinced myself to stay. It just got to the point where I was extremely miserable in my job and loathed working in an office. I had many hobbies over the years and I've travelled all over the world. I consider myself to be an adventurous individual. I wanted to do something completely different but at the time I didn't know what else I wanted to do career wise.

There were several family deaths in my family over the last few years  including a young child which contributed to me leaving my job. I decided to retire early at the age of 47 and take a year off from working. I receive a health insurance and a pension which pays all of my bills. I have a home and rental property which are both paid off. I have zero debt and no children. I have only about 100k in a retirement fund.

I decided to go back to school for nursing as a 2nd career. I only plan on working per diem and/or contracts for 7-9 months a year and taking off 3-5 months. I planned to invest my nursing salary to help build up my retirement funds and work until I'm 60-62. I don't plan to pull from social security until I'm 70.

I get these thoughts that pop up in my head everyday that I wake up since I retired letting me know I made a huge mistake. That if I would have stayed at my job I could be done working at 56 and I wouldn't have to put in effort into a 2nd career.

These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&amp;P 500.  

Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors.  And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time.  As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&amp;P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.  

Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this?  I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&amp;P by 1.5% to 2% annually.

Thailand

Cons: too much of sexpats, trashy backpackers and people with low to zero moral standards suddenly walking around thinking they are kings while in the west nobody wants to deal with them.

91,Give This Idea a Score 1-5.,"Hi all, 

Here is a business idea. 

One problem we have heard retirees say repeatedly is that you have waited for your whole working career to travel, but now that this time has arrived, you can't because of your pets. You love your pet but crave your freedom. So what do you do?

Pet boarding is too expensive if you are going on a trip longer than a few days. 

Online pet-sitting apps- You don't know who these people really are or if they will care for your pet correctly.

Friends and Family- You might not have a network you feel comfortable asking this big favor, and if you do- it is still a big commitment especially if you plan on taking that extended trip. 

Solution: Therapy Paws. A company that partners with you to give your pet specialized therapy training. Then when you are gone, we partner you with a local health facility (hospital, assisted living facility ect.) that has trained employees who will both take care of your dog and use the dog in the rehabilitation/treatment of the facility's residents. This will allow you to get training and boarding at an affordable price and give you the comfort and peace of mind knowing your pet is doing important work while you are away.

99,SSA Underpays Delayed Credits in First Year,"I'm amazed not to have read the following anywhere while planning retirement, so I thought I'd alert others to how delayed credits work. I know it's no use to rant against the system, but there's no place else to scream where anyone will listen. So please excuse the rant - it feels good to be able to do it somewhere.

As you all know, your benefit is increased by 1/12 of 8% (2/3%) for each month you delay retirement past full retirement age. What they don't tell you clearly is that the increase in benefits won't start till the January after retirement. 

For example, if on January 1 of this year I have 19 delayed credits, then choose to retire in July, I have a total of 25 delayed credits  and my benefit will increase an amount totaling 25 * 2/3% = 16 67%. However. My initial benefit payments (July through December) will only include 19 credits, or a 12.67% increase.

Starting in January, they'll recalc the benefit using 16 67% (which now includes the extra credits), but the government won't retroactively adjust the six months of benefits that were calculated at the reduced 12.67% amount.


**Start rant**
What a surreptitious policy. The government pockets from 1 to 11 months for each of us if we delay retirement but don't start in January. Why don't they calculate your benefit with the correct delayed credits from the start? If their software is archaic and can't, fine - but pay retroactively what is due. Sure, once you realize what they've done, you can go back and read their policy and understand what it meant. 

=&gt; If you retire before age 70, some of your delayed retirement credits will not be applied until the January after you start receiving benefits.

But no one spells it out that you potentially lose hundreds in your first year.

101,Roth IRA income ceiling exceeded - looking for other tax advantaged options.,"This year was the first year where we exceeded the income ceiling for being able to contribute to a Roth IRA. Of course, I didn't know that that would be the case until well after I'd already made my contributions. My tax accountant (Turbo Tax) said I'd need to withdraw the Roth IRA contributions from last year and reallocate them to a Traditional IRA - What are the ramifications for just leaving them in the Roth? And how is that verified by the IRS?

My next question is regarding alternate investments for the would-be Roth IRA funds going forward; because of my income level there doesn't seem to be any tax deduction advantages to contributing to a Traditional IRA so would that even still be a good investment at this point or should I just consider investing the money into stocks or indices through a financial institution like Schwab or Fidility or something? Also, for context, I already max out my 401k so I can't increase contributions there.

Over the past decade, we have managed to save up to $85,000. Now, we are thinking of trying to figure out a way to aggressively save for retirement. We are hoping for possibly early retirement. We have no idea what to do with the money we saved up to help with retirement.

Today all we hear is that there is a potential recession and that there is going to be a potential crisis. So far there is this war with Russia going against Ukraine. Then we are hearing about a war between the US against China over Taiwan. We are hearing everyone talking about how the stock market is going to be pretty violated for some time. We are also hearing that the stock market may crash big time.

I wished we had invested a lump sum of that money into a 401k because of the upward trend that we have been seeing for the past decade. But now I am not sure if that is such a good idea. The main reason why we didn't put that money into a 401k is that we were planning to use the money to buy a house. We ended up finding a very good large home for a very good price. Our mortgage stands at about $600 a month with 3.5% interest for 2000 sqft with a massive garage separated garage that is between 1500 sqft. It was originally an investment property until Covid hit. We are starting to think that this may be a permanent home for us.

The home was a fixer-upper. We managed to get a very good loan from the city that is 15 years with no interest. It was about $30,000. The home has new sidings, kitchens, fencing, mini splits, windows, etc. I did all of the work myself because it was significantly cheaper.

I know that we are off to a very good start and that we are in our early 30's. But here are the problems that we are facing. My fiancee is getting the feeling of being burned out. She has been hopping jobs in hope of finding a stable job with no luck. The current job that she has now is a state job. She gets very good health insurance with $2500 max out of pocket. The job also comes with a pension that she has to pay into for 5 years to qualify for the retirement plan. There is no 401k plan here. She is already thinking of finding another job because of the extreme workload and she is getting burned out.

She is also pressuring me into having a baby when I have not figured out my career path. I am not guaranteed to get into flight school at the moment. I am going through the Medical Evaluation that I have been dealing with for over a year. She gets upset when I tell her that it is not the time to think about a baby. She is worried about being too old to have a baby.

I am not sure if finding a financial advisor is a good option. I fear that because of the huge sum, they will try to take advantage of it. I have no idea how to find out if the financial advisor is in for the best of us or for themselves.

I have a friend who I am close with, with some advice that we should do a three-thirds. One-third for risky, one-third for medium risk, and one-third for low risk. She also explains that if we go in for the long term, we are bound to make money back. I am afraid of losing a lot of money and then it takes forever for it to grow back. I am afraid of never being able to retire.

If I stop working at 60 but still take SS at 63, does that $2500 still apply or will it be less?

*Q. You retired, then unretired last year. Is retirement overrated?*

*A. “Retirement” is a scary word. I mean, you’re not retiring from life. So, when I am done with football, I believe I have many chapters to write. You’ve got to keep your mind busy. You’ve got to keep your body active. You’ve got to keep your spirit active. You’ve got to do things you enjoy doing with people you enjoy doing them with.*

*Q. Let’s say the moment eventually comes. What would an ideal day of retirement look like?*

*A. You know, 23 years into this career, some decompression and relaxation would be good. It would be nice to be a little slower paced in the morning. I still want to be really productive with things that I’m doing in the midday and then make sure I’m a present father for my kids and give them all the time they need.*  


Makes sense to me! It describes my retirement well, substituting “my spouse” (who is still working) for “my kids”.

Everything I've read elsewhere seems to lead me to ""WHICH IS BETTER A ROTH OR A TRADITIONAL iRA...""

There has to be more to it than that.

I'm by no means destitute but my income is not high and fluctuates.  I'm self employed. Wife is raising the kids and making limited money.  We're essentially a 1 income family.

I'm in a low tax bracket so the limited research I've done has me thinking I should be throwing as much as I can at a Roth ira.

Roth sounds like the best idea because in case of an emergency I can...

1 access it without penalty and

2 I'm in a low bracket now and I'm trying to make that go up.

Other than that I have a very low amount of cash savings/ investments and a rental property that's doing a little better than covering expenses... I'm lucky to rent where we live for an unreasonably low amount.

Can i get some real world experience?  If you just want to tell me I'm stupid and screwed then keep that to yourself.  I already feel that way.  If you have similar experience or suggestions to improve my planning I'd really appreciate your input!

124,Q for those that retired early but still had to generate an income,"Curious to hear from folks that retired when they hit their employer’s “magic number” (well before being eligible for SSI and medicare) to receive health insurance benefits for life (paid in whole, or in part, by said employer).

In a few years, I will reach my company’s “age of 75” that will allow me to officially retire with health benefits. I will continue to be able to pay the same monthly cost for my health insurance, and at 65, my supplemental medicare costs would be defrayed. 

This early retirement milestone could allow me a creative sabbatical to relocate near some family in another part of the country. I feel that this is a good opportunity, and wanted to hear others’ experiences about how they bridged - or are bridging - their time until full retirement.

I struggle with the guilt of not being willing to contribute a significant portion of my discretionary budget so that my relative can live in a nicer place, despite her complete lack of planning.  If you are a person who cares about the lives of others, what are your thoughts about this?

Thanks"

141,Dental &amp; Vision Insurance on a Limited Income,"Any good deals (ha-ha!) for dental and vision insurance for senior citizens?

I'll be taking early retirement from my job on 31 March and will turn 65 in September. I do not want to retire, but I live with my elderly, widowed father whose mental condition is deteriorating, and my brothers &amp; I have agreed not to have dad put in a nursing home, and he doesn't want it either. They are in no position to leave their careers to care for him--both are married, one lives 1,000 miles away while the other is 10 miles away. I'm divorced with children and grandchildren living across the country, so I'm in a better position (somewhat) to care for our father as I don't have extra family responsibilities (except for dad). The brother closest to me helps as much as he can and is always willing to fix things around the house and checks on dad regularly.

I've never had a career, only jobs, and have had one job after another. I've applied for my SS check which starts in April--which I'd done it sooner--but since I've never had a career, it won't be a large amount, about $1000 per month. I've been a receptionist for a non-profit organization since 2012. I moved in with dad after mom died three years ago, he pays for everything (HOA, water, electric, property tax, cable) while I'm responsible for my own bills and I buy all the groceries. I'm debt free although I've recently run up a big dental bill (oral surgery, implants, crowns) as my insurance doesn't cover it all. I don't earn much money (an understatement) but I don't have as many expenses, either. I only have about $21,000 in my 401-K, not very much, and I absolutely don't want to touch that money if possible. Dad is leaving me the the house (an old mobile home) and most of his savings/investments, which don't add up to much but that's okay. Right now it seems as though I can survive on my monthly SS check and a VA pension (ex-hubby was career military), it's around $2000/per month.

Question: I'm a veteran and am not worried about medical insurance as I can use the VA, and then I can use Medicare if I want, but I can't find reasonable dental insurance--and my teeth are costing me a fortune. I'd like to avoid spending all of it on dental/vision care, although I've heard that just paying out of pocket is sometimes cheaper than insurance. I may not get paid very much, but I only pay about $50 a month right now for medical/dental/vision. All that will stop beginning in April &amp; I have no idea how much I'll have to shell out. I want to avoid asking dad for help. I know he'll do it, yet I don't want to unless I'm desperate.

I can't understand why Medicare doesn't cover this stuff--your eyes and teeth tend to worsen as your age.

146,"Will Social Security get fixed before 2034? And if so, how?","The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that by 2034, Social Security will not have enough money to fully fund its obligations.  In other words, as of that year, they cannot continue to pay out 100% of the amounts to retirees.  The amount that SS can afford to pay will be reduced to 77% going forward from that point.  

Will Congress fix this before 2034 such that there will be no reduction?  There are a number of ways that it can be fixed; here are the 4 most popular ways:  

1. Lift the cap on taxing earnings for SS.  As of 2023, the first $160,200 of your earnings are taxed.  Any earnings you receive above that are not taxed.  Lifting this cap entirely would be the most effective way of aiding SS.  
2. Put in a means test for collecting social security.  Right now, if you pay money into the system, you can get money out of the system - no matter how much your net worth is upon retirement.  A means test would examine your 
3. Raise the retirement age.  This has already been done due to lengthening life spans.  The ""full retirement age"" used to be 65.  In 1983, Congress passed an increase, which has been phased in to the point where those people born in or after 1960 now cannot collect their full retirement benefits until age 67.  People can still retire before full retirement age, starting at age 62, and receive reduced benefits.  Both the minimum age and the full age can both be raised again, as life expectancies continue to rise.   
4. Increase the SS payroll tax.  In 2023, you pay 6.2% tax on the first $160,200 of earnings; and your employer matches that 6.2% payment.  Obviously, this rate can be increased.  

There's a good article describing these ways, and a few others, and their effects, [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/changes-americans-are-willing-to-make-to-fix-social-security.html).

170,One advantage to having a brokerage account vs. 401k/IRA/etc.,"I've recently started looking at a bit of estate planning as I am aging.  I am still a number of years from retirement, but my health isn't perfect and given my family history, I probably won't be around to enjoy more than a few years of it when I get there before I pass on.  Most of my planning revolves around making sure that my wife, who is nine years younger than myself, is taken care of when I pass on. One thing I discovered recently is that a regular taxable investment account has 1 major advantage over a tax deferred retirement account, at least for someone in my circumstances.

When I pass on, my wife will inherit everything. The money in my traditional 401k will be taxed as regular income when she draws upon this money. But the assets in my normal investment account enjoy 1 special benefit. Currently if I sell shares from my investment account (which I have no intention of doing) I would have to pay long term capital gains based upon the cost basis of those shares when I sell.  But should I pass away, the cost basis of all of those shares is reset to the price of the stock on the day I passed away.

Example: I was lucky enough to buys shares of Microsoft (MSFT) at $36 a share many years ago.  Today it is bouncing around the upper $200s per share.  I would have to pay taxes on around $225/share in capital gains.  But if I died today, the cost basis resets to today's price.  My wife would pay capital gains on a cost basis, if I passed away today, of around $262.  That is a lot of tax savings for her!

And since my estate is nowhere near the $5 Million exclusion for my state's estate taxes or the $12.92 Million exclusion for federal estate taxes, my estate would pay no taxes before transferring my assets to my wife.  My state is unfortunately one that also charges a roughly 10% ""inheritance tax"" to people who inherit (in addition to the state estate tax and the federal estate tax if you exceed the exclusions on these) but for immediate family members such as my wife this tax is not assessed.

Now I am not saying that this one advantage makes a taxable account ""better"" than a tax-deferred account, but it does give those of us who use these accounts in addition to tax deferred accounts one good thing if we have relatives that we are looking to provide for when we pass on. As for me, I am continuing to build both my 401k and my taxable accounts so I will hopefully buck the trend of other men in my family and enjoy a long retirement (none of them have even lived TO retirement age). And if not, at least it will help a bit for taking care of my wife when she outlives me by quite a long time.",retirement,"One advantage to having a brokerage account vs. 401k/IRA/etc. I've recently started looking at a bit of estate planning as I am aging.

180,Hanging tough redux,"Seeing Doodle’s post on hanging tough for 18 months brought my own situation to mind. 

Well, a few differences. The stressful person is my direct report and not bigoted but chronically angry and bellicose. I’ve coached this person to little avail. And the work successes this person generates just barely outweigh the exhausting behavior. When the person recently made noises about a transfer, my boss said not to make any retention overtures. The person told me recently she “declined the transfer position” but I suspect she wasn’t offered it.

And I don’t get a pension, but I’ll vest in a level of employer contributions to my 401k and some modest restricted shares. So I keep repeating my milestone vesting dates like Arya Stark’a hit list. My kiddo finishes a combo bachelor/master’s program June 2024. With the recent market fluctuations we’re not as bad as a few months ago but a bit under target. My spouse isn’t earning much but brings in a little (works in the arts). We wouldn’t be destitute but this last cushion will make it easier. I’m trying to be responsible to my family but I’m running out of f*cks to give at work.

The SS calculator for each of us says we'll be getting $3500/month each at full retirement age 70.  $7K/month = $84K per year.  

That's fixed income payments - which is exactly what bonds would give us.  At a 4% bond payout rate, that would be the equivalent of holding something like 

# TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS. 

Or, since I can't sell off any of that, you can think of it more as annuity.  A lifetime annuity for a 70-year old pays around 6%.  That's still the equivalent of buying an annuity for 

# $1.5 MILLION DOLLARS.  

To those who say that SS will run out of money in 2037, that's not exactly true.  SS will not be able to pay out 100% of its obligations by then.  But from what I understand and what I've read, it will still be able to pay out 75% of its obligations - basically forever.  And that's if Congress does nothing to fix it. in the meantime.  That's still $63K/year = $5250/month, which is the equivalent of having either $1.5 million in bonds, or buying an annuity for $1.125 million. 

This all leads to the question:  **if I'm going to get this much FIXED INCOME from SS - and I'll easily have one million in my portfolio -  what do I need bonds for?**",retirement,"Why not think of Social Security as the equivalent of bonds/annuities So, I'll most likely have somewhere between $1.2 and $1.4 million when me and the wife retire in about a dozen years.  We've got two-thirds of a million right now; we'll each continue to max out our Roths - $7500/year x 12 years x 2 of us = $180K; and additional investments in our non-retirement accounts of about $10K per year x 12 years = $120K.  So that's practically a million right there with 

We have no bonds.  Let me repeat that:

210,Moving to potential “retirement” location in 40s or wait?,"I’m in my early 40s and work remotely and have the flexibility with my employer to move to any state we currently do business. I work for a large company so this is almost any state in the US plus Puerto Rico. I live in the midwest and assume I will either be a snowbird or move down south during retirement because I’m not a fan of our winter.  I got to thinking maybe I should just move now while my kids are in elementary school and increase the chances they will have ties to that location. Plus this will allow us time to settle and have a sense of community.

Potential downsides that I see include:
-moving far from our parents/siblings who all live within 30 minutes from our house
-We have a low interest rate on our house and are on track to having it paid off in 10 years. Would likely pay more for “less” house as our current home was built pre-crazy housing prices.
-We live in a good school district &amp; safe neighborhood. May not like new location.

Im leaning towards Alabama or North Carolina due to weather and the fact that my company has a big presence there (just in case I need to return to the office or I take a hybrid role) but Phoenix or Colorado are my husband’s top picks.

Or would you recommend the snowbird route? If we do that I’m assuming we would stay in the Midwest and spend 2-3 months somewhere warm. I would love to hear about anyone’s experience moving from the Midwest to somewhere with better weather or being a snowbird.

211,Robinhood Roth IRA vs Acorns,"I want to clarify that the Robinhood Roth IRA is the better option when compared to the Acorns Roth IRA. From what I understand, Robinhood offers 1% matching and no monthly fee. Acorns does not match, and charges a small monthly fee. Am I missing anything else? 

I have a Roth IRA on Acorns. If I were to make the switch to Robinhood, what would be the best option? Roll over my Roth IRA funds from Acorns to Robinhood? Or keep them in my Acorns account and only contribute to my Robinhood account? 

It sounds like it would be better to roll over to the Robinhood account to avoid the Acorns monthly fee. However, I’m very new to all this and I’m not sure if there are other things I should be taking into account.

213,Drawing from Investments in Retirement,"Would appreciate any input as I will be discussing with my financial advisor.  
I’m about to turn 65 and retired about a year ago.  I haven’t touched my investments this far, but will need to start later this year.  Currently have a general investment account (not a retirement account), an IRA and a 401K which is in my old company’s Vanguard account.   The retirement accounts are NOT Roth. The question is which accounts do I draw from and how much cash should I hold for to handle annual expenses? 

I do not plan to take Social Security until I am 70 and about that time our mortgage will be paid off (I see no need to pay it off given the low fixed mortgage rate), so cash flow will increase significantly at that time.  

I always figured that I would draw from my regular account and wait to take money from the retirement accounts, but I’m wondering if I should do the opposite or a blended withdrawal given what could be substantial RMDs when I turn 75.

217,How do you factor the cost of assisted living in your retirement budget?,"I know, at 20, 30 or 40 we do not think a lot about things like that, but if you already budget for retirement, you might as well factor in some health care costs. Let's assume you have Medicare at 65 and most of the medical costs are covered. But what about the need of assisted living at some point? I had no idea but was wondering what to roughly expect. I googled and found an interesting article with lots of statistics on assisted living: 

[https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-statistics](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-statistics)

Here are some numbers I found in the article, and I think the last three are important for my rough estimates. I assume that I am in average health and that there won't be additional costs for any devastating long-term diseases. 

Just a very rough estimate but according to the statistics one would need to budget 22 months x 4500=$99000. So $100K minus medium retirement income is $50K minimum. Of course, this depends on many other factors, like LCOL or VHCOL area, your actual retirement income and individual health and so on. 

I guess if some more serious disease comes up early in retirement, these numbers will increase drastically, though. I am also sure there is lots of horrible anecdotal evidence for these cases as well and the associated costs can get be exorbitant. On the other hand, the more frugal-minded may also look into organizing their very own assisted living arrangements and, for instance, share living space and cost of services on an as needed base.

 

* Assisted living communities offer long-term housing and care for seniors. Residents often need help with various activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing, bathing, and using the toilet, but they do not require 24-hour nursing or medical care.  
* 42% of residents experience Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia. 
* White, non-Hispanic families are the least likely to care for an aging relative at home, and they are the most likely to seek senior living communities before medically necessary. 
* Women in the U.S. tend to live longer than men. The average life expectancy for women is around 81 years, while the average life expectancy for men is 76 years 
* Approximately 71% of assisted living residents are female, while 29% are male.  
* The majority of residents move into assisted living communities between the ages of 75 and 84,  
* The average age of an assisted living resident is 87.  
* The median cost of a private, single bedroom unit in an assisted living facility is $4,500 per month.

Since the past 2 years, I used the services of a financial advisor who works for an independant private financial service group.

He took the time to analyse my earnings, debts and long-term / short-term goals. He suggested me to open a TFSA (equivalent to a Roth IRA)

He suggested me to invest the contribution I am allowed to all in Fidelity Global Equity Mutual Fund (FID7601). 
Since this is for the long term (retirement) and that I won't touch this money for 30-35 years from now, I am worried about the total management fees which are at 2,26%.

Each dollar lost in fees, is a dollar less growing.

Over a few decades, it will cost me hundread of thousand of dollars in fees. I would have to cross my fingers the mutual fund he suggested me beats the market by at least 2,26% on the long term. The statistics say it's highly against my favour.

Would I be better to directly open an account with Fidelity or Vanguard and make my own portfolio with a passively managed fund like an Idex fund or ETF? The fees would be much lower. 

I know it's against his advantage to suggest me a passively managed fund, because it means lower fees therefore less money for him.

231,Retirement Budget,"A question on budgeting for retirement.   I have been tracking our expenses for the last 12 months.  I am trying to plan for a retirement budget.  I plan to have mortgage paid off in the next 12 months.  So I removed that expense from the retirement budget.  I also removed FICA, Medicare taxes, and my 401k deductions.    

I left in my current employee benefits costs and money I have been putting into a HSA.  I am thinking those two should pay for medical until I reach 65. 

I understand we may have less commuting costs but these seem small vs my 401k and FICA deductions.  

Are there and costs that may go away that I am missing?   How about significant new costs that I may be missing.  Obvious we hope to travel more and I have separate line item for that.

244,The 4% Rule,"I see a number of people working very hard and saving in a 401(k) or IRA (or Roth IRA). Are you aware of the 4% rule? Have you spoken to your advisor about it? 

Google ‘The Trinity Study’ and read up on this. The safe withdrawal rate from a 401(k) or IRA in retirement is 4%. Why? 

If you are like me, you’ve sat in a room with your colleagues at work and listened to a financial advisor tell you that when you’re young, you can accept more risk, as even if your account value drops, the market always rebounds and you’ll make up the difference and then some. In your later years, you need to be more risk adverse, to protect your money, converting stocks to bonds. That conversion slows you’re rate of growth to provide security. In order to preserve your money with that slower rate of growth you should only withdraw 4% per year. Factor in compounding management fees and your money isn’t going that far when you need it, in retirement. 

Go to vanguard.com and run your numbers on the retirement calculator, it’s there in black and white. 

There are alternatives to the 4% rule. Whether you want to entertain them is up to you. Just understand that between management fees and placing your money in conservative investments when you need it the most, in order to make sure you don’t run out of money before you die, your recommended withdrawal rate (as will be confirmed by your advisor) is 4%. Plan accordingly…which is a euphemism for ‘be ready to downsize.’",retirement,"The 4% Rule I see a number of people working very hard and saving in a 401(k) or IRA (or Roth IRA).

247,My approach to dividend retirement,"Hi all! I decided to share my approach to the choice of dividend stocks, maybe someone will be interested

I divided my needs into separate industries and choose dividend companies among the leaders of this market. 

The logic is that if some products will grow more expensive than inflation, then the dividends of companies in this sector will grow at a similar rate, and therefore I will still have enough dividends to buy the products of this company.

In theory, this should safeguard my dividend flow from global demand changes, compared to if I had simply chosen the companies with the largest and most stable dividends. It also answers the question of exactly how to diversify my choice of dividend stocks. 

[In the video I tell in detail how I chose companies in my potential portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9bJNSl58PI&amp;t=29s)

In response, a lot of people posted strategic and tactical ways to save money for retirement, while still paying the normal expenses related to child-rearing. Those suggestions were excellent, and I can't add to them.

However, I want to point out an opportunity that arose in our marriage during the time between ""I do"" and the arrival of the first child. In the four years during our marriage before our first child was born, my wife and I saved an amount equal to about sixteen months of our combined salaries. We put that money into a mutual fund portfolio with a mix of about 75% stocks and 25% bonds. That was about 29 years ago.  During the first 28 years after we opened the account, we did not add any ""new"" money to the account, and did  not sell any shares. We reinvested all capital gain and dividend distributions. Late last year, I sold about 4% of the shares to fund a Donor Advised Fund account (which will eliminate our federal income tax liability for 2022),

According to my favorite Monte Carlo simulator, Vanguard Nest Egg Calculator, there is a 99% probability that this account will pay all of our annual expenses for the next 20 years. By that time, of course, we will qualify for  the maximum Social Security old age benefits, and will also have to take RMDs from our retirement accounts.

269,"Were you able to start any new, expensive, and space-consuming, equipment-heavy hobbies after you retired?","I am guessing that a lot of people dream of retiring so that they can devote time to things like restoring old cars, bronze sculpting, or woodworking. Has anyone been able to take up this sort of hobby *after* retirement? I'm sure there are a lot of people who have been doing it all along, and already own all of the equipment and space, but are able to devote their attention full-time after retirement, but I'm asking if anyone has been able to take up such hobbies from scratch, acquire all of the equipment and space, knowing you won't get to use it for very long. 

I am currently attempting to liquidate everything in my parents' house, then the house. My mother has spent 50+ years being a (semi-well-known) ceramic artist. There are quite literally tons of equipment and art pieces to get rid of. She, however, has never had to relocate and has never had a normal job, so it is a matter of 50 years of equipment and art accumulating. 

Being pretty handy myself, I've always dreamed of retiring in a space where I could have woodworking and metalworking equipment, so I could finally just build stuff for myself when I retired. Specifically, I have always wanted to take up bicycle frame building as a hobby, but as you can imagine, that takes up a lot more space and equipment than something like crossword puzzles. Unlike my mom, I've been working for 30+ years in an incredibly fickle industry, so I've had to relocate more times than I can remember for work. Every time I've moved, I've purged, which included a lot of hobby stuff. I have lived in a string of tiny 1 bedroom condos and apartments for my entire career and have never had things like a garage, a yard, or a basement.

Now that I'm hopefully 8-10 years out, I'm realizing that if I invest all this money and space in hobbies, not to mention a house to put them in, I won't really have that long to actually do them. I figure I might have maybe 10 years or so before I found I wasn't physically capable anymore and would have to get rid of it all. It kind of makes me wonder if I should find some less involved hobbies for retirement.",retirement,"Were you able to start any new, expensive, and space-consuming, equipment-heavy hobbies after you retired?

276,Inherited portfolio value is down. What are consequences of 72 year old widow selling now?,"My friend inherited her deceased spouses stock portfolio  3 years ago. She told me the stocks were valued around $200k at that time but are worth about $140k now. She is considering selling and putting the proceeds into an interest bearing account. Her broker advises against this. 

Tax implications are what is holding her back on selling. It is my understanding that the original value of the stocks in her case would be the stock value at time of inheritance so she would have capital gains loss. Is this right?

She sold their house 2 years ago and put that money in an interest bearing account. She collects SS survivor benefits and has a 401k, which will require withdrawal at 73, correct?

She is really stressing over what to do to preserve the value of these stocks. 

I should add that she is renting now, but planning to purchase. Proceeds from her house sale will not cover full price of another home as husband had refinanced and spent equity withdrawal. She would need to either sell stocks or get a mortgage on future house.

I clearly cannot advise her but I'd like to be able to discuss rhia accurately with her.

He has a pretty strict “things I can’t do” list and it’s hard to narrow it down to something that checks all the boxes he’s looking for. Hoping you guys here can help out.

1.) He can NOT stand for long periods of time; he doesn’t mind moving around a lot or sitting but he can’t STAND STILL for long periods of time 
2.) He is ONLY looking for work that is MEANINGFUL. This means he has little interest in doing something let pet sitting or teaching history (he has a bachelor’s in history). He is more interested in helping refugee children, helping the elderly, etc. Basically anything that makes him feel like he’s actively making peoples lives better or the world a better place.
3.) He ISN’T good at conversing for long periods of time. He’s introverted and is good at talking around his friends but with strangers he tries to keep his conversation to a bare minimum. If he was to work with people, he would not want to go through small talk, he would just want to talk to them about things that are important or necessary.

I am trying to find housing that solves the problems of affordability, loneliness, minor physical limitations, and yet, is also practical.","I don't have any family that is able or willing to help. My husband died several years ago. Due to some personal problems and health concerns, I'm not comfortable living alone. I am not poor but I need to be wise about money. 

Ideally, I'd love to find something like an intentional community of older folks, but most of the ones I've found either require a $200,000+ buy in (where you buy a tiny house in the commune) or they have a bunch of children. I'm looking for something that's peaceful, settled and quiet, where I can form new friendships with like-minded souls. 

Alternatively, I'd love to find a shared home situation, where I can split expenses with someone who has a spacious home. I did that 20 years ago, and it worked beautifully for me and the homeowner. I've tried countless ""home-sharing"" websites but to no avail.

I would be grateful to hear any and all ideas. I was engaged to a man that was the love of my life, and we had a beautiful set-up (sharing expenses in his condo), but then he found someone he liked better and ditched me the day after Christmas. I was so grateful to have found him, and I thanked God every day for him, but he had no hesitation about putting me out of his life. I'm still hurting from the abrupt break up (and eviction). I'm currently living with a lovely couple, but this is temporary. 

Thank you for any and all ideas. Please be gentle with me. I'm in my 60s and so tired of trying to just survive.

I am trying to find housing that solves the problems of affordability, loneliness, minor physical limitations, and yet, is also practical. I don't have any family that is able or willing to help. My husband died several years ago. Due to some personal problems and health concerns, I'm not comfortable living alone. I am not poor but I need to be wise about money. 

Ideally, I'd love to find something like an intentional community of older folks, but most of the ones I've found either require a $200,000+ buy in (where you buy a tiny house in the commune) or they have a bunch of children. I'm looking for something that's peaceful, settled and quiet, where I can form new friendships with like-minded souls. 

Alternatively, I'd love to find a shared home situation, where I can split expenses with someone who has a spacious home. I did that 20 years ago, and it worked beautifully for me and the homeowner. I've tried countless ""home-sharing"" websites but to no avail.

I would be grateful to hear any and all ideas. I was engaged to a man that was the love of my life, and we had a beautiful set-up (sharing expenses in his condo), but then he found someone he liked better and ditched me the day after Christmas. I was so grateful to have found him, and I thanked God every day for him, but he had no hesitation about putting me out of his life. I'm still hurting from the abrupt break up (and eviction). I'm currently living with a lovely couple, but this is temporary. 

Thank you for any and all ideas. Please be gentle with me. I'm in my 60s and so tired of trying to just survive.

Any other ideas also welcome. 

Some particulars:
He is 69, will retire in the next few months. 
SS will gross around 2500/mo. so he will be above poverty level.
He will be able to be covered under NYS EPIC, which is excellent since he is on a very expensive drug for Stage 4 prostate cancer.

288,How much do you really need?,"Planning retirement in a few years and of course, the question comes up as to how much do you need on an annual basis to retire.

307,To Retire 15 Years Early Stop Buying These 15 Things,"Let’s begin

By the way I have a gift for you at the end of this post.

1) Mortgage

Mortgages can keep the middle class poor because they often involve taking on significant debt in order to purchase a home. This debt can take years or even decades to pay off, during which time a significant portion of one's income is committed to paying mortgage interest and principal. This can limit one's ability to save and invest, reduce disposable income, and make it difficult to cope with unexpected expenses or emergencies. Additionally, if property values decline, homeowners may find themselves owing more than the value of their home, which can make it difficult to refinance or sell their property. As a result, homeownership, which is often seen as a means of building wealth, can become a burden that contributes to financial insecurity for many middle-class families.

2) Credit card interests

Credit card interest can keep the middle class poor because they can lead to a cycle of debt. Credit cards often come with high interest rates, which can cause debt to accumulate quickly if the cardholder is unable to pay the balance in full each month. This can lead to minimum payments that only cover the interest, meaning the cardholder is not making any progress towards paying down the debt. Over time, the interest and fees can become so high that a significant portion of the cardholder's income is being used to service the debt, leaving little for other expenses or for building savings and wealth. This can also lead to financial insecurity and increase the risk of default, which can have long-lasting impacts on one's credit score and financial health.

3) Higher education

Higher education can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class in several ways. Firstly, college tuition and fees have been rising faster than inflation for many years, making it more difficult for families to afford higher education for their children. This can result in taking on large amounts of student loan debt, which can be difficult to repay, especially if the student is unable to secure a well-paying job after graduation. Secondly, the opportunity cost of pursuing higher education, including lost wages and the cost of living expenses, can also be significant. This can reduce the amount of money that students and their families have available for saving, investing, and building wealth, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Finally, the burden of student loan debt can also make it more difficult for graduates to make other important financial decisions, such as buying a home or saving for retirement, which can further contribute to financial insecurity.

4) Constant Smartphone upgrades

Constant smartphone upgrades can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they can be expensive and add up over time. Smartphones are often marketed as must-have devices that are quickly outdated, leading many people to upgrade to the latest models on a regular basis. This can result in significant recurring expenses, especially as the cost of smartphones continues to rise. Additionally, many people finance their smartphones through installment plans or carrier financing, which can result in paying higher prices overall and incurring interest and fees. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for saving and investing, contributing to financial insecurity in the long-term. The desire for constant upgrades can also contribute to consumer debt, which can have similar effects on financial security.

5) Luxury vehicles and car accessories

Luxury vehicles and car accessories can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are often expensive and require a significant investment. Purchasing a luxury vehicle or upgrading a car with expensive accessories can be tempting, but can also result in taking on significant debt or diverting resources away from more important financial goals such as saving for retirement or building an emergency fund. Additionally, owning a luxury vehicle can also result in higher operating costs, including higher insurance premiums, fuel costs, and maintenance expenses. These added expenses can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, contributing to financial insecurity in the long-term. Furthermore, luxury vehicles and car accessories can also be depreciating assets, meaning that they lose value over time, which can make it more difficult to sell the vehicle or trade it in for a newer model.

6) Premium cable and streaming services

Premium cable and streaming services can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are recurring expenses that can add up over time. While these services can be convenient and offer a wide selection of content, they can also be expensive and require a significant ongoing investment. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, subscribing to multiple services can also lead to ""subscription fatigue,"" where people have difficulty keeping track of their monthly expenses and may find themselves overspending on entertainment. This can also result in a cycle of debt, as people may use credit cards to finance their monthly expenses, incurring interest and fees that add to the overall cost of the services. Overall, premium cable and streaming services can be a source of financial stress, especially for those on a tight budget or struggling to make ends meet.

7) Home renovation and home decoration

Home renovation and decoration can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are often expensive and can result in significant debt. While home improvements can be a source of pride and enjoyment, they can also be a financial burden if not approached with caution. Renovations and decorations can quickly become expensive, and financing these projects through loans or credit cards can result in high interest charges and fees. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, overspending on home renovations and decorations can also lead to financial stress, especially if the improvements do not increase the value of the property or do not meet the homeowners' expectations. Furthermore, many people may feel pressure to keep up with their neighbors or to have the latest and greatest home furnishings, which can lead to overspending and financial insecurity.

8) Dining out and takeout food

Dining out and takeout food can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they can be expensive and add up over time. While these options can be convenient and provide a variety of food choices, they can also be a significant source of monthly expenses. Eating out or ordering takeout frequently can result in significant spending, especially if dining at high-end restaurants or ordering premium food items. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, dining out and takeout food often involve discretionary expenses, meaning that they are not essential expenses, and can be reduced or eliminated altogether if necessary. By choosing to dine out or order takeout frequently, people may be diverting resources away from other important financial goals, which can contribute to financial insecurity. Furthermore, frequent dining out or takeout can also result in unhealthy eating habits, which can lead to additional health-related expenses.

9) Fitness classes and gym memberships

Fitness classes and gym memberships can lead to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These activities can be expensive, especially if they involve frequent participation or require a long-term commitment, such as a gym membership. Additionally, the cost of fitness classes and gym memberships can add up over time, making it difficult for people to afford other necessities, such as housing, food, and healthcare. Additionally, for some individuals, the social pressure to maintain a certain appearance or level of physical fitness can drive them to spend more money on these activities than they can afford. Ultimately, if not carefully managed, fitness classes and gym memberships can become a financial burden for the middle class, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being.

10) Gourmet food and specialty ingredients

Gourmet food and specialty ingredients can be a financial burden for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These items are often more expensive than regular food items, due to factors such as high-quality ingredients, artisanal production methods, and premium branding. Additionally, purchasing gourmet food and specialty ingredients on a regular basis can quickly add up, putting a strain on a household's budget. Moreover, these items are marketed as status symbols, leading some individuals to feel pressure to purchase them in order to maintain a certain image or lifestyle, even if they cannot afford to do so. Ultimately, if not managed carefully, gourmet food and specialty ingredients can contribute to financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

11) Videogames

Videogames can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. Many video games are expensive, especially new releases or popular titles. Additionally, video games often require additional purchases, such as DLC (downloadable content) or in-game purchases, which can add up over time. Furthermore, some individuals may feel pressure to keep up with the latest releases or to compete with others, leading them to spend more money on video games than they can afford. If not managed carefully, the cost of video games can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

13) Travel and Vacations

Travel and vacations can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. Travel and vacations can be expensive, especially if they involve airfare, lodging, meals, and other expenses. Additionally, some individuals may feel pressure to take expensive trips or to travel frequently, leading them to spend more money on travel and vacations than they can afford. Furthermore, some individuals may go into debt or incur other financial obligations in order to finance their travel plans, which can further exacerbate their financial problems. If not managed carefully, the cost of travel and vacations can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

14) Plastic water bottles

Plastic water bottles, while relatively inexpensive individually, can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed carefully. Purchasing plastic water bottles regularly, especially if they are used as the primary source of drinking water, can add up over time, putting a strain on a household's budget. Moreover, plastic water bottles create a significant amount of waste and contribute to environmental problems, including plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from their production and transportation. Therefore, using plastic water bottles can have indirect financial consequences for the middle class, as addressing the environmental problems caused by plastic waste can be expensive. Ultimately, if not managed carefully, the cost and environmental impact of plastic water bottles can contribute to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

15) Pet care and Pet grooming

Pet care and pet grooming can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These expenses can be costly, especially if they involve frequent visits to a vet or pet grooming services, or if they involve high-end pet products. Additionally, some individuals may feel pressure to provide their pets with the best possible care, leading them to spend more money on pet care and grooming than they can afford. Furthermore, unexpected veterinary expenses, such as those resulting from an injury or illness, can add to the financial burden. If not managed carefully, the cost of pet care and pet grooming can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

15) Your friends and family

It is a well-known fact that the people we surround ourselves with have a significant impact on our lives. This is especially true when it comes to financial success and upward mobility. The middle class is no exception to this rule. In fact, their tendency to associate with others of the same socio-economic status may be one of the reasons why they remain stuck in the middle class.

One of the reasons why this phenomenon occurs is that people tend to feel comfortable with those who are similar to them. The middle class is made up of individuals who have achieved a certain level of financial stability and success, but are still a ways away from reaching the upper echelon of society. When they come together, they share similar values, experiences, and goals. As a result, they form strong bonds and relationships with one another.

However, while these relationships can be comforting and provide a sense of community, they can also be limiting. By surrounding themselves with others who are also in the middle class, these individuals are not exposed to new ideas, opportunities, and perspectives. As a result, they may not be as motivated to strive for more, or to seek out new ways to improve their financial situation.

The middle class’ tendency to associate with others of the same socio-economic status can keep them stuck in the middle class, preventing them from reaching their full financial potential. By surrounding themselves with individuals who are already financially successful, they can learn new strategies, gain access to resources, and be inspired to reach for more.

By the way I have a gift for you at the end of this post.

1) Mortgage

Mortgages can keep the middle class poor because they often involve taking on significant debt in order to purchase a home. This debt can take years or even decades to pay off, during which time a significant portion of one's income is committed to paying mortgage interest and principal. This can limit one's ability to save and invest, reduce disposable income, and make it difficult to cope with unexpected expenses or emergencies. Additionally, if property values decline, homeowners may find themselves owing more than the value of their home, which can make it difficult to refinance or sell their property. As a result, homeownership, which is often seen as a means of building wealth, can become a burden that contributes to financial insecurity for many middle-class families.

2) Credit card interests

Credit card interest can keep the middle class poor because they can lead to a cycle of debt. Credit cards often come with high interest rates, which can cause debt to accumulate quickly if the cardholder is unable to pay the balance in full each month. This can lead to minimum payments that only cover the interest, meaning the cardholder is not making any progress towards paying down the debt. Over time, the interest and fees can become so high that a significant portion of the cardholder's income is being used to service the debt, leaving little for other expenses or for building savings and wealth. This can also lead to financial insecurity and increase the risk of default, which can have long-lasting impacts on one's credit score and financial health.

3) Higher education

Higher education can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class in several ways. Firstly, college tuition and fees have been rising faster than inflation for many years, making it more difficult for families to afford higher education for their children. This can result in taking on large amounts of student loan debt, which can be difficult to repay, especially if the student is unable to secure a well-paying job after graduation. Secondly, the opportunity cost of pursuing higher education, including lost wages and the cost of living expenses, can also be significant. This can reduce the amount of money that students and their families have available for saving, investing, and building wealth, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Finally, the burden of student loan debt can also make it more difficult for graduates to make other important financial decisions, such as buying a home or saving for retirement, which can further contribute to financial insecurity.

4) Constant Smartphone upgrades

Constant smartphone upgrades can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they can be expensive and add up over time. Smartphones are often marketed as must-have devices that are quickly outdated, leading many people to upgrade to the latest models on a regular basis. This can result in significant recurring expenses, especially as the cost of smartphones continues to rise. Additionally, many people finance their smartphones through installment plans or carrier financing, which can result in paying higher prices overall and incurring interest and fees. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for saving and investing, contributing to financial insecurity in the long-term. The desire for constant upgrades can also contribute to consumer debt, which can have similar effects on financial security.

5) Luxury vehicles and car accessories

Luxury vehicles and car accessories can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are often expensive and require a significant investment. Purchasing a luxury vehicle or upgrading a car with expensive accessories can be tempting, but can also result in taking on significant debt or diverting resources away from more important financial goals such as saving for retirement or building an emergency fund. Additionally, owning a luxury vehicle can also result in higher operating costs, including higher insurance premiums, fuel costs, and maintenance expenses. These added expenses can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, contributing to financial insecurity in the long-term. Furthermore, luxury vehicles and car accessories can also be depreciating assets, meaning that they lose value over time, which can make it more difficult to sell the vehicle or trade it in for a newer model.

6) Premium cable and streaming services

Premium cable and streaming services can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are recurring expenses that can add up over time. While these services can be convenient and offer a wide selection of content, they can also be expensive and require a significant ongoing investment. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, subscribing to multiple services can also lead to ""subscription fatigue,"" where people have difficulty keeping track of their monthly expenses and may find themselves overspending on entertainment. This can also result in a cycle of debt, as people may use credit cards to finance their monthly expenses, incurring interest and fees that add to the overall cost of the services. Overall, premium cable and streaming services can be a source of financial stress, especially for those on a tight budget or struggling to make ends meet.

7) Home renovation and home decoration

Home renovation and decoration can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are often expensive and can result in significant debt. While home improvements can be a source of pride and enjoyment, they can also be a financial burden if not approached with caution. Renovations and decorations can quickly become expensive, and financing these projects through loans or credit cards can result in high interest charges and fees. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, overspending on home renovations and decorations can also lead to financial stress, especially if the improvements do not increase the value of the property or do not meet the homeowners' expectations. Furthermore, many people may feel pressure to keep up with their neighbors or to have the latest and greatest home furnishings, which can lead to overspending and financial insecurity.

8) Dining out and takeout food

Dining out and takeout food can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they can be expensive and add up over time. While these options can be convenient and provide a variety of food choices, they can also be a significant source of monthly expenses. Eating out or ordering takeout frequently can result in significant spending, especially if dining at high-end restaurants or ordering premium food items. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, dining out and takeout food often involve discretionary expenses, meaning that they are not essential expenses, and can be reduced or eliminated altogether if necessary. By choosing to dine out or order takeout frequently, people may be diverting resources away from other important financial goals, which can contribute to financial insecurity. Furthermore, frequent dining out or takeout can also result in unhealthy eating habits, which can lead to additional health-related expenses.

9) Fitness classes and gym memberships

Fitness classes and gym memberships can lead to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These activities can be expensive, especially if they involve frequent participation or require a long-term commitment, such as a gym membership. Additionally, the cost of fitness classes and gym memberships can add up over time, making it difficult for people to afford other necessities, such as housing, food, and healthcare. Additionally, for some individuals, the social pressure to maintain a certain appearance or level of physical fitness can drive them to spend more money on these activities than they can afford. Ultimately, if not carefully managed, fitness classes and gym memberships can become a financial burden for the middle class, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being.

10) Gourmet food and specialty ingredients

Gourmet food and specialty ingredients can be a financial burden for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These items are often more expensive than regular food items, due to factors such as high-quality ingredients, artisanal production methods, and premium branding. Additionally, purchasing gourmet food and specialty ingredients on a regular basis can quickly add up, putting a strain on a household's budget. Moreover, these items are marketed as status symbols, leading some individuals to feel pressure to purchase them in order to maintain a certain image or lifestyle, even if they cannot afford to do so. Ultimately, if not managed carefully, gourmet food and specialty ingredients can contribute to financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

11) Videogames

Videogames can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. Many video games are expensive, especially new releases or popular titles. Additionally, video games often require additional purchases, such as DLC (downloadable content) or in-game purchases, which can add up over time. Furthermore, some individuals may feel pressure to keep up with the latest releases or to compete with others, leading them to spend more money on video games than they can afford. If not managed carefully, the cost of video games can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

13) Travel and Vacations

Travel and vacations can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. Travel and vacations can be expensive, especially if they involve airfare, lodging, meals, and other expenses. Additionally, some individuals may feel pressure to take expensive trips or to travel frequently, leading them to spend more money on travel and vacations than they can afford. Furthermore, some individuals may go into debt or incur other financial obligations in order to finance their travel plans, which can further exacerbate their financial problems. If not managed carefully, the cost of travel and vacations can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

14) Plastic water bottles

Plastic water bottles, while relatively inexpensive individually, can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed carefully. Purchasing plastic water bottles regularly, especially if they are used as the primary source of drinking water, can add up over time, putting a strain on a household's budget. Moreover, plastic water bottles create a significant amount of waste and contribute to environmental problems, including plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from their production and transportation. Therefore, using plastic water bottles can have indirect financial consequences for the middle class, as addressing the environmental problems caused by plastic waste can be expensive. Ultimately, if not managed carefully, the cost and environmental impact of plastic water bottles can contribute to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

15) Pet care and Pet grooming

Pet care and pet grooming can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These expenses can be costly, especially if they involve frequent visits to a vet or pet grooming services, or if they involve high-end pet products. Additionally, some individuals may feel pressure to provide their pets with the best possible care, leading them to spend more money on pet care and grooming than they can afford. Furthermore, unexpected veterinary expenses, such as those resulting from an injury or illness, can add to the financial burden. If not managed carefully, the cost of pet care and pet grooming can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

308,"For those who have retired on dividends and collect SS, what is the role of bonds in your portfolio?","So, I'm obviously asking so that you can look at what I'm doing and see if it makes sense.  My current ""plan"" is to retire on dividends in about a dozen or so years at age 70.  Me and my wife will collect about $7000 in SS each month, and my retirement portfolio will be well over a million by then.  It's currently at two-thirds of a million, mostly in VOO.  The million is a very, VERY conservative estimate. 

The plan would be to take my current investments, sell them off, and invest them in dividend ETFs.  It would be a mix of JEPI/DIVO/SCHD, with an emphasis on JEPI, and DIVO and SCHD thrown in to get some good growth to keep ahead of inflation.  I figure I can do a mix of something 60/20/20 respectively and get good growth and still get a nice month income of at least $5000 (about $60,000 per year).  Again, this is a very conservative estimate.  I think it'll be closer to $6000 per month.  

Obviously, this is subject to change to whatever the hot dividend producing ETF is in a dozen years.  

So, with that said, what is the role of bonds in a portfolio and plan like this?  Bonds are supposed to provide a steady source of income to flatten out the highs and lows of stocks.  You're ""supposed to"" hold a percentage of stocks equal to your 120 minus your age.  At age 70 I'm supposed to be 50/50 stocks and bonds - I'm only a dozen years away, and I'm at 0%.  

SS will be providing us with that steady monthly income.  What do I need bonds for?  

Even if SS gets cut after 2037 (the projected year when SS will not be able to cover its current level of payments), it is predicted to still be able to cover 75% of its obligations, basically forever.  $7000 x 75% = $5250 per month.  

Again, what's the role of bonds?  Do you collect SS and still hold bonds?  Why?  

Thanks in advance.",retirement,"For those who have retired on dividends and collect SS, what is the role of bonds in your portfolio?

311,Someone else’s life,"I’m getting pretty close to retiring, I think. I’m 58 and have set the goal at 60, assuming I can get health insurance and the stock market cooperates. 

But even though I’ve really been focused on retirement for a long time (I mean, a LOOONNNNGGG time 😁), I actually am finding myself having second thoughts. There’s still this part of me that’s looking for the next great role or job title, that feels like I haven’t reached my full potential in my career and life. I don’t feel 58…. I feel 35 (except for my knees—those are definitely feeling 58). 

I’ve put down a lot of feeling that way to “programming”—ie, how we’re programmed, especially in the US that work is who we are, if we do good work we’re good people (thank you Protestant work ethic…) and just that who we ARE is, in large part, what we DO. And I’m sure that programming has a lot to do with how I’m feeling (I also blame movies like “Wall Street” and “Working Girl” and even “Baby Boom,” all movies that probably influenced me right around the time I was starting my career).

But I also just realized that probably a bigger reason for feeling that way is that honestly, I’ve been pretty much living someone else’s life. Which is of course related to that programming. But at some point I put my shoulder in and said “ok, this is just what we do,” and of course started making money (and often buying things to make me feel better about living someone else’s life). 

I’m an artistic type person, and making money has never really been that important to me, EXCEPT for the security money buys. Never wanted a big house or fancy car, I hate dressing up, I’m don’t even like to travel that much. I do like writing and art and music and making things…. And that’s kind of what I saw myself doing much earlier in life.

I feel like I went to the bus station intending to go to Miami but I got on the wrong bus and just realized I’m heading to Juneau, Alaska. And am almost there. 

And it’s not all about work, maybe not even mostly about work, but is about life, and work is a big part of that. 

So maybe I have time to changes busses in Seattle to head back to Miami. Maybe I won’t make it to Miami, but Panama City may not be too bad.

That fiasco probably cost us $20k in New furniture, etc.

Anyway, she is not drawing her ss. We are living off of my salary. I just think that if she doesn't want to work. That is ok, but she should be drawing her ss at least. How can I convince her to draw ss?"

320,Question retiring at 70 in the US,"My father has been confused about the SSA retirement paycheck process. He just passed 70 in October 2022 and was debating on retiring now.

He told me that he read that he can take 6 months' pay upfront, but that would lower his monthly payments moving forward, since they would pay a chunk out ahead of time. However, since he hasn't taken his retirment yet and now he's 70 + 3 months, does that mean that they would pay for the months that he hasn't received yet (3 months), and not change the amount that he would otherwise get on a monthly basis, considering he would have taken it in October?

338,I hate my partial dentures. I regret getting rid of my teeth. What did you do for those who feel the same? (age: 60),"Hello again! Im writing for my father whos about to turn 60 again for health tips. I got such an overwhelming amount of response last time that i wanted to ask for help here again! 

Recently, he just got most of his teeth removed. He smoked since the age of 15, and hasnt had the best diet and self-care within all of these years. His teeth and gums were ruined even though he had great dental “genes”. When my parents went to the dental clinic, after a lot of dentist shopping they found one that made more sense then the other ones who suggested a lot of deep cleaning (which would result in a lot of money thrown out and the teeth would just end up falling since they were shaking every time we went in for deep cleaning). Hes a proud greek for having had his teeth for this long, and now he seems really depressed over having partials. Especially his top partials. Its not comfortable at all for him. And hes a chef and loves the taste of food. The fact that he cant taste food as much is heartbreaking to him. And the plastic feel on the top of his mouth is really irritable. He really misses his teeth, even though they were less pleasant and shaking. I think he just started having a lot of pain in his teeth at one point, so we really started looking for the right dentist on his occasional days off. And the dentist said he’d only remove the bottom to see how he feels - but at the appointment it was the technician instead who spoke very little, and just left 10 teeth in his mouth. 

He’s ready to spend a lot more money now that all of it happened. And it’s heartbreaking to see him the way he is. We can hardly understand him speaking - its as if he has something in his mouth when he talks. Were trying to save our money to pay off the mortgage when its going to be due in 2-3 years, but with this now…

After being in Outside Sales for 30 years, and going through what I have experienced these past 8 years, I’m completely burned out. Hate Sundays where I get that pit in my stomach thinking about work on Monday, and the pressures of sales targets, traveling, long meetings, etc. I think you get the picture. I’m fried and don’t want to do it anymore. Life is too short.
I have $2.1 in Retirement that consists of $300K in Qualified IRA’s inherited from my parents, $600K in Stocks/Mutual Funds/Treasuries, and $180K in Roth IRA’s. The remaining $1M is in 401K Rollovers from previous jobs. I have $200K in cash (Savings) along with Checking , etc. I have $76k in my current employer 401K. Total Retirement of close to $2.3M

House is paid for and we have no other debt. I have one son at home who is 19 and going to Trade school and working full-time. He will be leaving the house soon. My oldest son is 22 and has moved out of the house. He will graduate in May 2023. Their college education is paid for with our 529 Accounts.    There will be close to $40K left over from that account. 
We have a financial advisor who hasn’t been great in providing guidance. We since have met with 2-3 advisors that we’re thinking of moving our money too, and all have said that I’m in a good position. Our expenses are close to $90k, and that should come down further once our youngest leaves the nest. My wife makes close to $16K working PT, so that would reduce our expenses to roughly $74k. There is room to carve out some more.
I want the freedom to do what I want, and not have to have report in to somebody. Learn a new hobby. Enjoy life and not have a plan everyday, and just go with the flow. I worry about having too much idle time, but I’m sure everyone does. 
We’re very frugal people and don’t spend a lot of money. I’m a little scared, but at the same time excited about a new chapter in my life. 

I would appreciate any comments and thoughts as to whether or not I’m in good shape, and should not even think twice about moving forward with retiring.

My oldest son is 22 and has moved out of the house. He will graduate in May 2023. Their college education is paid for with our 529 Accounts.    There will be close to $40K left over from that account. 
We have a financial advisor who hasn’t been great in providing guidance. We since have met with 2-3 advisors that we’re thinking of moving our money too, and all have said that I’m in a good position. Our expenses are close to $90k, and that should come down further once our youngest leaves the nest. My wife makes close to $16K working PT, so that would reduce our expenses to roughly $74k. There is room to carve out some more.
I want the freedom to do what I want, and not have to have report in to somebody. Learn a new hobby. Enjoy life and not have a plan everyday, and just go with the flow. I worry about having too much idle time, but I’m sure everyone does. 
We’re very frugal people and don’t spend a lot of money. I’m a little scared, but at the same time excited about a new chapter in my life. 

I would appreciate any comments and thoughts as to whether or not I’m in good shape, and should not even think twice about moving forward with retiring.
I would love to hear how you enjoy retirement and did any of you consider retirement at my age of 55."

344,What are your thoughts on getting a benefit plan for retirement?," 

I will be retiring this summer and scared as hell but my wife will be still working, she is 9 years my junior. I have a good benefits plan from my current employer of which I use the dental and some of the drug coverage. My wife uses more, dental, drugs as well as physiotherapy, natural path, massage, etc.

I’ve been calling around various insurance providers and it seems we could get a similar coverage for 400$ per month, 200$ each. We don’t know what my retirement means to us financially yet but we are reassured by our financial advisor/planner we will be ok, but we are both scared. So, does it make financial sense for both of us to get benefits for 400$ a month? Should we get benefits for my wife only for 200$ month and none for me, pocket 200$?

What are your thoughts and advice.

349,"tax time - what's your actual % yield from invested cash, that you're using to fund your lifestyle?","Everyone has different circumstances, tax strategies and so on, and we all are familiar with the concept of the safe withdrawal rate.  


But I am really wondering how people who have been retired for a minimum of 5 years are doing in terms of capital base (invested cash) versus after-tax, spent cash.  


in my mind, there is an abstract ratio that could be expressed as a ""yield"" for lack of a better term. For example, if the total cash amount excluding fixed assets like home equity or various trusts amounts to $100,000  - again, not the total net worth, but only the cash sitting in investment vehicles like IRA's and portfolios - if that cash is invested and the income from capital gains and distributions is (maybe partially) used for life expenses, what percentage does that come to for you?  


I'm trying to ask in such a way that people can comfortably answer this without needing to divulge anything too personal. If your investment portfolio is $10m and you fatFire on $500k per year, your ""yield"" is 5% - and if you're on a $900k living on $45k, you're also a 5%.  


Of particular interest for me in this inquiry is how things pan out at the end of the year, when everything is said and done, budgets are reconciled, maybe some of the anticipated expenditures weren't needed and got reinvested, or maybe the opposite and you had to sell equities to pay for unplanned things, raising the ""yield"".

Also, do you think I should try and contribute more to my 403b before my Roth?

I’ve been trying to understand this on my own but I can’t wrap my head around it for some reason! I appreciate your advice and support!"

382,Another Should I take SS retirement benefit now or wait until age 70 topic - seeking opinions,"My wife and I have been planning to wait till age 70 for each of us, to maximize the SS payments. However, today I put the actual numbers into a spreadsheet and am wondering if that is the best choice. 

We are 65 and 66 years old now, and both are retired. Both in good health, for our ages. We don't have expensive lifestyles, and can survive without taking SS for now. But certainly if there were more money, I'd be happy to buy more toys. The house and cars are paid off. I calculated the possible income from SS if I started taking it now, vs at age 66.5, vs age 70. I included a yearly 4% interest addition, in case I would just save the money in a high return savings account, like Citibank or Synchrony bank. What I found is that the age 70 - delay scenario doesn't catch up to starting SS payments now until 2045, when I would be 88. Even the FRA case, starting at age 66.5 is not much better, catching up in 2044 at age 87. 

This seems a little surprising to me, since the financial advisers seem to usually advocate delaying taking SSI. Will I really make it to age 87? The insurance companies don't think so. Is there a significant impact on my wife's survivor benefit if I would delay that I should take into account? I believe her own SSI payment will be a little more than half of what mine will be, so maybe she would not take a survivor benefit if I would die before her.",retirement,"Another Should I take SS retirement benefit now or wait until age 70 topic - seeking opinions My wife and I have been planning to wait till age 70 for each of us, to maximize the SS payments.

385,IS RETIREMENT FUN? WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY?,"Don’t be fooled by retirement’s handshake with the long shadow of having fun in old age. To illustrate, I’ve had a life-saving cardiac procedure, arthritis, cataracts, hearing loss, lung scarring, and poor hand circulation. Time in old age is like compound interest on a loan. Eventually, we end up frail, sick, and dead. So how do I reconcile the prospect of kicking the bucket with feeling healthy, strong, and vibrant most of the time? I remind myself not *to* take life too seriously because nobody leaves this world alive.

My wife (age 65) and I (age 68) play competitive tennis; make occasional whoopee while the sun shines bright; participate in a book club; eat sushi with our friends; remodel our house; donate annually to local charities; and never take our general health for granted. I am grateful that our careers prospered, mostly my wife’s profession, during the last four decades, which allows us to live comfortably.

One positive byproduct of retirement is being numb to the opinion of others. If I take the garbage out, dress in my pajamas, and wear mismatched clothes in public, no problem. Why didn’t I develop this courage and vulnerability in my thirties? Today, I give hugs, ask for what I want, and give a helping hand to strangers. The result is I feel good about myself most of the time. Have you ever heard the saying - *you can't sprinkle perfume on others without getting a little on yourself?*

Being warmhearted and attentive is a value in our marriage. Recently, my wife surprised me with a soft, colorful throw for my afternoon naps on the sofa. In turn, my sleepy-head wife wakes up every morning to a cup of hot coffee on her night table. My love language is acts of kindness.

Now and then, negativity creeps into my head, tainting my perception. People seem uncaring, drivers appear rude, and life is unfair. Falling into a melancholy state can happen to anyone. Once I recognize my state of mind, I tell myself to snap out of it. Then I remind myself life is less about what happens to you and more about how we respond to it. In other words, the quality of our life is what we make it.

The twenty-first century is the greatest time to be alive, especially for older adults. We benefit from the advances in medicine and the study of seniors. For instance, gerontologists break down the three time periods so that we can maximize our lives. The research segments our vitality and ability to walk: go-go years (age 65 - 74), slow-go years (age 75–84), and no-go years (85+). Knowing this big picture motivates me to take better care of myself so that I can travel.

Up to now, we have sidestepped life-threatening illnesses like cancer, diabetes, and other life-altering injuries. We try to eat nutritious foods, drink alcohol sparingly, and exercise regularly. One underrated part of self-care is rest and sleep. After a workout, it is vital to allow your body to recover. More importantly, through regular doctors' visits, our high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and mild arthritis are controlled with medication.

At this stage of living, life is not a sprint but a very slow marathon. Having fun requires juggling work ethic (exercise and nutrition), relationships, and stimulating activities you love. I try to live with low expectations and gratitude for the little pleasures. Yes, there is an element of luck in life because health is not guaranteed.

397,"Taking Cash When Rolling Over, Bad Idea?",,retirement,"Taking Cash When Rolling Over, Bad Idea? "
398,Depleting an IRA,"I am considering my options and wanted to float this idea past you.

I am a Green Card holder, living in the US, not a US citizen. I have retired. I ended up with an IRA with $8 million. Plain IRA, not a ROTH. I do not have a ROTH IRA. I want to move back to my home country at age 80. As I understand it, I cannot keep an IRA in the USA while not a resident.

I think I need to empty the IRA over the next 13 years, pay all the taxes, and reinvest some outside the IRA. Then when the time comes, I can move what's left overseas legally, with all taxes paid, and no issues.

Assuming there is no growth in the IRA, just to simplify things, then to deplete it between now and then, means that over the next 13 years, I should take an annual distribution of $615,000, pay Federal and state taxes, live off some of it, and then reinvest the rest.

That means I take an annual $615,000 distribution, pay $163,000 Federal tax, and $35,000 Virginia tax, use $120,000 for living expenses, and have an excess of $297,000 per year which I would reinvest. After the 13 years, the IRA would be empty, I would have paid $2.1 million Federal tax, and $455k state tax, and have $3.8 million invested free and clear. I could then move that $3.8 million around the world, free and clear. Effectively, that's about a 32% tax rate, with Federal and state combined.

Yes, I know I have to pay US taxes for the rest of my days, as well as my home country's taxes. I have to submit a US tax return each year for the rest of my days. But after the money is out of the IRA, and it's reinvested, income will be generated by dividends, and sales of equities (long-term capital gains) and the tax rate would be a little lower than the 32%.

It's sort of sad to see $8 million deplete to $3.8 million, but the tax has to be paid one way or another, and I will have lived off it for those 13 years too. Still, that converts to an even better amount when moved to my home country.

Is my thinking really screwy? Are my assumptions wrong? Is there a better way to do this?",retirement,"Depleting an IRA I am considering my options and wanted to float this idea past you.

I am a Green Card holder, living in the US, not a US citizen. I have retired. I ended up with an IRA with $8 million. Plain IRA, not a ROTH. I do not have a ROTH IRA. I want to move back to my home country at age 80. As I understand it, I cannot keep an IRA in the USA while not a resident.

I think I need to empty the IRA over the next 13 years, pay all the taxes, and reinvest some outside the IRA. Then when the time comes, I can move what's left overseas legally, with all taxes paid, and no issues.

Assuming there is no growth in the IRA, just to simplify things, then to deplete it between now and then, means that over the next 13 years, I should take an annual distribution of $615,000, pay Federal and state taxes, live off some of it, and then reinvest the rest.

That means I take an annual $615,000 distribution, pay $163,000 Federal tax, and $35,000 Virginia tax, use $120,000 for living expenses, and have an excess of $297,000 per year which I would reinvest. After the 13 years, the IRA would be empty, I would have paid $2.1 million Federal tax, and $455k state tax, and have $3.8 million invested free and clear. I could then move that $3.8 million around the world, free and clear. Effectively, that's about a 32% tax rate, with Federal and state combined.

Yes, I know I have to pay US taxes for the rest of my days, as well as my home country's taxes. I have to submit a US tax return each year for the rest of my days. But after the money is out of the IRA, and it's reinvested, income will be generated by dividends, and sales of equities (long-term capital gains) and the tax rate would be a little lower than the 32%.

It's sort of sad to see $8 million deplete to $3.8 million, but the tax has to be paid one way or another, and I will have lived off it for those 13 years too. Still, that converts to an even better amount when moved to my home country.

Although, i'm of course not the same as my dad - fitness wise. 

I brought him back to my gym with my carry-along-someone-w/u pass, and I brought him to the stair master since last time he had a hard time jogging on a treadmill. After 3 minutes he backed out and said ""i'm dead"" ""we should do this everyday"" 

I didn't feel like I got much from going to the gym but if I can help him then it makes me happy to help - And I feel bad to workout while he's just sitting there, so I try to do the same workouts as him. I've got other means anyway - at home. 

He's a chef, and he's been just working in a restaurant for about 40 years. He was a big smoker, but since covid, he would go on the patches often. Some periods he would go as long as 8 months without smoking. Then he would start again, and then he would go on the patches. He's a compulsive personality (he gambles too) so telling him that he should completely quit for life would just not work and make him miserable. So as his daughter i'm trying to help with baby steps. He's got high blood pressure (which he takes pills for) and it looks like he's got knee problems. So I'm wary about how to help him train.

436,Is it a mistake to pass on a service buyback for my pension?,"Hi all,

I just started a new job (city government - parks and rec) that and they offer a service buyback program with a pension that takes 10 years to be vested. I was initially excited about this because I didn't know such programs existed. I have about 3 and a half years of government service (same industry) that I didn't reach the vested period (spent 3 years at one municipality, 7 months at another). 

I asked to get some more information from HR/finance about the program. While they couldn't give me an exact figure until I reach out to my previous employers, they were able to give me a ballpark figure, stating that generally speaking, 3 years of service would cost between $15-25k 

Simply put, I don't have that. Even if I went the rout of paying for it over the course of 3 years through payroll, I did the math and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $500/month. With a modest salary ($68k), HCOL area, and student loans, that doesn't seem like a good financial decision.

That said, I've read that you should always buy back when you can.

Any advice?",retirement,"Is it a mistake to pass on a service buyback for my pension? Hi all,

440,roth conversions,"I don't really expect a direct answer to my situation, but I have been trying to analyze/compute the optimum roth conversions.  I have what I think is a modestly sophisticated spreadsheet that takes into account expenses, inflation, SS, taxes, RMD's, investment returns ,etc.  I use the Excel non-linear Solver add-in the search for either the maximum end of life networth, or on the minimum taxes paid.

My intuition would say that minimizing taxes due to efficient tax conversions would also equate to maximum networth.  But the correlation is not there.  If I solve for maximum networth, it shows my plan paying  more in taxes.  But if I solve for minimum taxes paid then my end of life network is lower.

The results seem counter intuitive to me.  I have had several smart friends peer review the formulas in my model and no one has found an obvious flaw.  

I wonder if other people have examined the effectiveness of roth conversions and seen similar numbers.

My wife and I are quickly approaching 2025 which will be my 20 years of service at the Fire Department and 20 years of her working/contributing to her 401k.  We both have 401k's and I will have a decent pension from the FD that kicks in January of 2025(around $100k/year).  I have the rare opportunity from a department merger to continue working and begin a new pension and will go until 2033 or 2035 with the 2nd smaller pension vested.  My wife will continue some at home businesses that should also persist through retirement.  The 2nd pension will be small or converted over to an investment plan/401k'ish thing at the end if it makes more sense as my age will incur penalties on the 2nd pension. (Currently 59 years of age/25 years of service on 2nd pension to collect with no penalties)   


Come 2025 we want to utilize my pension to lay the ground work for our place of retirement.  We want to get out of Florida where we've spent our whole lives dealing with Hurricanes and well, Florida stuff.  Plan is to bank 1/3 for our tax bill, 1/3 to pay down our mortgage a little quick(about $180k left on a now $900k'ish home?) and 1/3 to down payment on land to build on/home in a different state.  Plan is also to really retire when we retire.  I don't want to work ever again if possible., after 30 years at the FD I don't think I should need too. (I have lots of hobbies, I won't get bored, promise)  


All that being said, we are having a hard time picking a place!  


We are Florida kids and hate the cold.  We want to pick a state that has good tax laws for retirees or low enough cost of living to offset having to pay taxes on our retirement.  Florida has good retirement tax laws but cost of living here is getting out of hand.  Our taxes and insurance will be up to $13k this year from $8k/year when we bought in 2013.

451,Roth conversion,"Roth conversion, x-post

Tldr, I can't see where a Roth conversion makes much sense, can you?

Let's pretend

Let's pretend Martha is averaging $30k/yr on dividends in a non-retirement account for several years.  It would seem to make the most sense of paying tax in a roth conversion year at the 24% bracket which is upto $391k of AGI (today's tax rates, who knows if it will change).   

So I think if that logic holds true, Martha would have to accommodate for the $30k of dividends and its impact on AGI and/or make a wholesale change to the portfolio where dividends would be paid out in retirement vs non-retirement funds (that would be an ugly tax choice, more cap gains).   

In addition, Martha would need to have enough other cash to sustain living such that she is not having to cash out more stock to pay bills - which if she did that approach, it would cause cap gains which would also increase  AGI.  

Complicating things - SS at (max) age 70 and RMDs at 75 (max now).

Bottom line - it feels like a really narrow fairway to hit on a ROTH conversion for someone with that scenario.   

The benefit of doing a ROTH conversion I'm seeing really is one to heirs - they won't be forced on a 10yr RMD withdrawal schedule (under today's tax rules).

I guess the secondary benefit would be compound growth tax free - but that's only if it has time to grow - so making this kind of decision maybe before 65 would be prudent.

So feels like the window is in the down income year until 65 or time of SS withdrawal is the window to do conversions - and the window is limited by any other income Martha is bringing in the door.

459,Effect of continued work on Social Security,"I am almost 60.5 years old, so not that far from first being able to get a (reduced) Social Security old-age (that is what is is called) benefit.  I was curious what effect it would have on my benefit if I stopped working, but did not collect the benefit, until ages 62, 67 (my Full Retirement Age), and age 70.

This is what I found out:

\--If I continue to earn the same amount  of money that I made last year, and have those earnings for every year until I draw my benefit, those extras years of paying Social Security taxes will increase my monthly benefit by about $10 per month, compared to the benefit that I would draw if I just stopped working this year,

\--If I really set the world on fire, and somehow make twice as much money as I made in 2021, and continue to make that higher wage until I start to collect benefits, my monthly payment will go up about $100, whether I start collecting at 62, 67, and 70.

Those numbers don't seem big enough to drive the decision on when to stop paying into the system

I have 3 401k accounts, two from 2 previous jobs I had, and one from the job I currently hold.

473,Want husband to retire early or semi-retire and go with me to China.," 

I'm married 11 years (together 13 years). We both are 38.

Both my parents has passed away a long time ago, now I'm at the point I just want to go back to China to be with my grandma (whom very old). My grandma leave her house to me in my name in event of my death, all the paperworks has been done and signed, so legally that house will be mine once my grandma die (and she very old right now).

I'm from Shanghai, and Covid right now is still very bad in Shanghai, so I can't go back to China at the momment. But Covid restriction will eventually has to ease down and I plan to fly back there as soon as it ease.

I want my husband to retire early and go with me to China.

Our financial situation is very simple and straightforward. I do want to see him retire early.

\--- Husband work at his job 15 years already and has 15 years of experience in his job field and has seniority at his job. He makes 130K a year take home (that is after taxes). He always very responsible with my money, he debt-free.

I'm also debt-free, I'm a frugal wife, penny pinching even. We don't haev a financial problem, we click as we both responsible with money.

\--- Our house which he pay in cash when he bought it in 2019 when it was newly build, we are the first home owner there. We have zero mortgage, it was paid all at once in cash. Not a big house or anything, a 1700 square feet house which is enough for the two of us to live in. He also own another house (which he brought for his mom to live in) which he paid it in cash, but it a 1200 square feet.

\--- He max out both his 401ks and IRAs every year, so this not a problem.

\--- Our Savings, cash liquidity he has 650K

Yes, Chinese love cash, lol. that why you see alot of Chinese buy house and paid their house in cash.

\---- No debt of any kind, each of us have a car, and it pay off too long ago. He has perfectly driving records all his life, so cars insurance is not high at all, he is 38 and perfectly clean driving record.

\--- Our healthcare is yeah, basically pay by his job.

\---- Stuff like bills electricity gas internet trash water etc... it cheap. I'm frugal, I don't even run the heater in the winter, does run AC in the summer but only when necessary. We don't even have cable, lol.

\---- He does have a life insurance policy. Along with his retirement, 401ks and IRAs which he max out both every year, so this is not a problem.

Like I say, we both are not spenders, we live very comfortable with his 130K a year income take home.

I do want him to go with me to China as soon as this Shanghai Covid restriction ease. Last time I visit my grandma as before Covid hit. And she very old, she can't wait, and if she die, I want to be there with her too.

478,Annuity for unemployed mother?,"My mother is 56 this year and residing in Florida. She recently received a 300,000$ inheritance from a relative who passed away. She is currently unemployed due to a car accident which left her with chronic pain. She is in the process of filing for disability but it could take another 1-3 years. She hasn't worked since 2020. That being said, her cost of living is pretty low. She owns a car outright and also owns her townhome outright with no mortgages/loans. So basically all she pays is utilities+gas+food+misc items.

The thing is-- I don't think she plans on working again, ever. She's currently living on 300,000$ in a savings account. That being said, I know this is not going to last forever. Cost of living will always go up as well as inflation.
I know she was considering investing the 300k into an s&amp;p index fund but that doesn't really solve her no income problem.

Playing around with an annuity calculator here --(https://www.schwab.com/annuities/fixed-income-annuity-calculator) --

If she were to buy a 225k annuity- for life- it would pay out somewhere between 1100-1300$ a month starting in February. She could also collect SS at 65 or 67 depending on when she chooses. The disability claim (if it ever gets approved) would just be additional monthly $$. I like the idea of her having 75k or so invested in an index or in a high interest savings account for emergencies (maybe a mix of both).

I know annuities are typically frowned upon for most people and their situations, but for her situation I believe there's no better fit to give her passive cash flow for the next 20-30 years so she can at least cover her cost of living.

I know she was considering investing the 300k into an s&amp;p index fund but that doesn't really solve her no income problem.

Playing around with an annuity calculator here --(https://www.schwab.com/annuities/fixed-income-annuity-calculator) --

If she were to buy a 225k annuity- for life- it would pay out somewhere between 1100-1300$ a month starting in February. She could also collect SS at 65 or 67 depending on when she chooses. The disability claim (if it ever gets approved) would just be additional monthly $$. I like the idea of her having 75k or so invested in an index or in a high interest savings account for emergencies (maybe a mix of both).

I know annuities are typically frowned upon for most people and their situations, but for her situation I believe there's no better fit to give her passive cash flow for the next 20-30 years so she can at least cover her cost of living.

Am I wrong or missing anything here with this financial planning?"

480,Mega Backdoor Roth - How to get 66k in a Roth this Year," 

For a lot of HENRYs, a question I see a lot online is how to properly execute a Mega Backdoor Roth, or how to get more in Roth retirement savings, even if you exceed income limits. Here is a guide my planning firm wrote on how to do it. **Keep in mind, limits mentioned in the guide use 2022 figures, not 2023 numbers. 2023 Figures are higher.**

Also, for folks nearing retirement, it may make sense to ensure your emergency cash reserve is higher in preparation for retirement. We generally like to have 1-2 years of liquid cash on hand in a retirees portfolio instead of the general 3-6 months of expenses. If pursing a Mega Backdoor Roth is going to jeopardize your emergency fund or other goals, you'll need to weigh the pros and cons/ how much to put in.

What I wanted to say about DAF it is slightly different.  As we approach retirement, we are in our highest earning years at the top of our careers and making the most money we ever have.  So we created a DAF as part of our retirement strategy.  This isn't for everyone, but this is how it works for us:

The DAF is an investment account you set up, that is a charitable giving account.  So we created our own little philanthropic foundation.  Let's say our highest earning year combined was $250,000 and we knew this would be our biggest tax year ever.  We set it up in that year and wrote a check to our foundation for $20,000.  That was an immediate tax write off.

Going forward, as we budget for retirement we do not have to budget for charitable giving which is really important to us.  Now that money is parked in an account where we can write checks from it to our charities.  And the money grows tax free as well.  So you or your investment advisor invest it and you decide how you want to money to be paid out to charities for the remainder of your life.

503,ROTH IRA vs Government 457 Plan,"Hi all, don't post much about retirement but figured this would be the spot. I have had some doubts lately that I may be making the wrong move regarding retirement. Little background, I work for state government and will be fairly young at retirement with a pension. I plan to be retired at 48. With that being said, I contribute 10% of my salary into the pension fund, and then by choose I max out my Roth IRA. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now initially I did this because I love the idea of post tax investing using the ROTH. Now I have always known that I won't be able to access this money until 59 1/2 but I still thought it was worth it. Now I am having slight second thoughts thinking that maybe I should just be doing the 457 Plan through work so I have the option to access it earlier if needed/want.

507,Help with when to take SS,"So I know the longer you wait to claim, the more money per month you will receive. The breakeven age is roughly 78. In the following scenario, why would I wait until FRA?

Married couple, same age, both in good health. Our temptation is to begin taking the money earlier so that we can use it while we're in good health. We don't necessarily need it to live--we'll have a pension and have plenty of retirement assets. By taping into SS early, we would leave all of those retirement funds untouched until RMDs.

So let's assume I begin collecting at age 62. I'm the lower wage earner. My monthly SS payment is $1980. From 62-78, I would earn $380,160. At 67, my monthly payment is $2813. From 67-78, I would earn $371,316.

So why would I wait? My spouse makes more, but the same scenario as above basically applies.

518,Retirement savings' guidelines,"I see frequent questions here of people comparing themselves to what financial writers say.

It is important to note that there are no hard set rules. Every personal situation is different.

At my job I frequently had to answer the question ""what will it take to do x?"" My answer was ""you want the 5 seconds answer, the 2 days answer or the 6 months answer?"" The 5 seconds was based on previous experience and could be ""between 1 and 2 million"" or ""1 to 5 people"" or ""between two months an a year"". For the 2 days answer I would have to do some research. For the 6 months, I may have to assemble a team to get to a clearer answer.

Think that all these ""rules"" are to give the 5 second answer to the ""how much should I save?"" Question.

There is:

- ""You'll need 70% of your income in retirement"". Well, if you live OK with 40% of income before retirement and your expenses won't change substantially, then given lower taxes, less than 40% gross will do. Note that 70% is not because you'll spend less, it's just because now you won't need to put x% in savings and your tax rate will be lower.

- ""If you withdraw 4%/3%/whatever%, on first year and adjust for inflation, it will last"". Well. It depends on a particular mix of investments. There are more conservative and more risk tolerant people. Some people have an expected short longevity, others a short one, etc. The truth is that we don't have a crystal ball so you need to review your finances frequently and adjust.

- ""You need to save 25x your annual expenses"". This comes from the same place as the 4% rule so same comments apply.

- And many others.

These rules always have some embedded assumptions. Different risk tolerance, country tax rules, retirement benefits, regional cost of living, family situation, expected longevity, lifestyle, etc. may substantially change the answer.

So, these rules help you focus on answering the question, However, you need take them with a grain of salt and see how the assumptions apply to you personally.",retirement,"Retirement savings' guidelines I see frequent questions here of people comparing themselves to what financial writers say.

524,Retirement Plan at Age 55,"Hi there! I’m posting this on behalf of my father as his daughter. 

My dad is 55 and has no retirement plan or savings. He owns a house but based on conversations he mentioned still owing a large amount (assuming he means well into his 60s or 70s). But my concern really lies in him not having any form of retirement savings accounts. As a 23 year old who just landed my first “real” job I am just now understanding and learning about 401k, Roth IRAs, HYSA and setting this up for myself.

But now I’m so miserable or angry, anger towards my husband because all he wants to do is play CandyCrush or puzzles. I feel like I’m missing out on so much life around us. He won’t go for lunch dinner unless he has to when company shows up. I asked him to go for a leisurely drive once (less than a half hour) to end the of this island that looks out on Gulf of Mexico. I get out of truck and start to stroll towards pier…he stayed in the truck!!! Just makes me feel like a heel. Another thing, he starts drinking beer at 2 so driving anywhere is out of the question. My problem is not being able to drive, I don’t feel confident enough to drive where we are, too much traffic!! Again I just feel like I’m missing out, I turn 60 in 2 months, and hate to see life wasted. We have no friends here in FLA. I guess I could order Uber and start going out on my own, but that’s expensive. Sometimes I think I should just get a divorce but after 40 years of marriage? Thanks for letting me vent.

527,I am torn on what % to put into my 401k...,"I am in a situation where I really don't need money at 36 years old. I inherited a paid off house, car is paid off, I have next to no bills, and I don't buy much. Everything is paid off. I currently have $13,000 in my bank and it's growing about $2k a month at this point. However, I have $0 in my 401k (opted out my whole life). 

So for now, I've set my 401k to 10% of my income (employer matches up to 6%). According to a retirement calculator, putting 10% of my income in a 401k instead of keeping money in my bank will result in roughly 83% more money if I retired at 65. That is a significant difference... Does that seem accurate..?

If so, given the fact I am behind in my 401k for my age, I am wondering if it would just be wise to start putting \~50% of my income into it. I'd still be adding roughly $1,000/month to my savings in the bank, while adding a large amount to my 401k. Personally, I feel like this is a good plan until I reach about $50,000 in savings, after which I planned to start putting closer to 80% of my income into a 401k.

528,Choosing type of allocated pension,"Now that I know I can access my super in an allocated pension due to meeting requirements (60F - finished a work arrangement), I’m finding it challenging working out which one is best, or even limiting my choices to a couple. 

I notice that Scott Pape (aka The Barefoot Investor) uses Hostplus Balanced Index fund for his super, however, his is in accumulation phase. 

I am wondering if others think the same Hostplus choice, but in an allocated pension option, is a worthwhile consideration?

I have an AustralianSuper accumulation account and their fees seem pretty high for their allocated pension account where one can select one’s own investments (ie ETFs). 

I also have a GESB West State super account, however, their allocated pension options don’t include being able to choose ETFs. 

I don’t have to have ETFs. I’m not a financial whizz, although I’ve definitely come a long way on my financial literacy journey of late (thanks to this forum and YouTube!).

It is understood that as you near retirement, you should increase your cash cushion so that you can weather market downturns without having to sell your securities at a significant loss.

Having no cash on hand for emergencies doesn't sound very attractive, since that would then require a sale regardless of the market conditions if a real emergency arose.

So how are the rest of you deciding when the market is ""good enough"", assuming that it hasn't recovered fully to a previous high, like we are in today?  It feels a whole lot like market timing.

542,what do you actually spend money on in retirement?,"I am almost 40 and between my wife and I we have about 300k in different retirement accounts. Our combined income is 160k and we save 20% a year currently.

544,"We both 38, want husband to retire early go with me to China. What age would fit in our situation.","Hi, sorry English is my third language. We both 38 (married 11 years, together 13 years), want husband to retire early go with me to China. What age would fit in our situation.

Both my parents has passed away a long time ago, now I'm at the point I just want to go back to China to be with my grandma (whom very old). My grandma leave her house to me in my name in event of my death, all the paperwork has been done, so technically legally I can live in that house whenever I want to go back to China.

\---------------------

Now my husband situation. We currently live in Texas. I been a housewife eversince married to him 11 years ago.

Our financial situation is very straightforward.

\--- Husband work at his job 15 years already and has 15 years of experience in his job field, he has seniority there. He makes 130K a year take home (that is after taxes). He always very responsible with my money, he debt-free. 

I'm also debt-free, I'm a frugal wife, penny pinching even. We don't haev a financial problem, we click as we both responsible with money. 

\--- He has a house which he pay in cash when he bought it in 2019 when it was newly build, we are the first home owner there. We have zero mortgage, it was paid all at once in cash. Not a big house or anything, a 1700 square feet house which is enough for the two of us to live in (I never wanted kids).

\--- He max out both his 401ks and IRAs every year, so this not a problem.

\--- Our savings, let just say the cash liquidity is no less than our house.

\---- No debt of any kind, each of us  have a car, and it pay off too. He has perfectly driving records all his life, so cars insurance is not high at all, he is 38 and perfectly clean driving record. 

\--- Our healthcare is yeah, basically pay by his job.

\---- Stuff like bills electricity gas internet trash water etc... it cheap. I'm frugal, I don't even run the heater in the winter, does run AC in the summer but only when necessary.

\---- He does have a life insurance policy. Along with his retirement, 401ks and IRAs which he max out both every year.

Like I say, we both are not spenders, we live very comfortable with his 130K a year income take home.

548,Trying to understand retirement costs,"So, I'm folloiwng posts on this sub and seeing people talking about how $1million probably isnt enough for retirement and its baffling to me. I'll put down my numbers I've done in a spreadsheet based on my expenses living in Connecticut. By retirement at age of 55 we will own our home and cars.

All expenses for both my wife and I = $2600/month. Medial insurance for both my wife and I = $1100/month. I'll figure in an additonal $500/month emergency

So absolute total expenses when we retire at 55yrs old = $4200/month

At age 62 we can collect $3800/month SS according to the .gov SS site. So we will need to bridge the gap between age 55 and 62 of $50,200/year X 7 years = $351,400 dollars needed to retire at age 55. Throw in maybe an extra $50k for a new shared car and some extra misc. expenses so lets just round it to $400k total....

I understand inflation, but some minimal investments should easily offset this.

Am I doing something incorrect with my math or am I missing an someting drastic to cost an extra $600k in extenses to hit the magical $1million+ needed to retire??

I have a lot of medical issues that only seem to be getting worse and we would like to retire around 55 years old to enjoy whatever healthy years I may have left.

565,Phases of Retirement,"I've just recently retired -- for the second time, sort of. I've been musing about what might be the next 30-40 years of my life (my family is very long-lived though of course you never know), and wondering about others' thoughts and experiences.

So much of my focus for much of my career was on making sure I would have enough money in retirement -- and I do. Now, part of me feels like the 17-year-old with dreams and wide-ranging interests, the 25-year-old who loved crafts of all kinds and actually quit the career track for a couple of years to work as a seamstress. This part feels like this is my chance now, to reinvent myself and do those things that I used to love, those things that got pushed to the back burner as I was swept away in stressful jobs. 

I watched the Four Stages of Retirement TED Talk at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMHMOQ\_054U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMHMOQ_054U), and I've been in Stage 3 since I ""semi-retired"" about 4 years ago. I bought a business and ran for my local Assembly and then served on the Assembly during the Covid years -- THAT was a challenge. I've got two more years in office. I do have a tendency to take on too much and then work like crazy to live up to my responsibilities. Though I did Just sell my share in my business; hence my retirement. :) 

Right now I am working every day on catching up on so many things that have been delayed or postponed for all of these years, clearing the shed and clearing the garage and emptying the storage unit and getting rid of all of this STUFF. But I also have this feeling -- this is my chance to rethink and reinvent my life.

TIA for reading and considering. Happy New Year!",retirement,"Phases of Retirement I've just recently retired -- for the second time, sort of. I've been musing about what might be the next 30-40 years of my life (my family is very long-lived though of course you never know), and wondering about others' thoughts and experiences.

So much of my focus for much of my career was on making sure I would have enough money in retirement -- and I do. Now, part of me feels like the 17-year-old with dreams and wide-ranging interests, the 25-year-old who loved crafts of all kinds and actually quit the career track for a couple of years to work as a seamstress. This part feels like this is my chance now, to reinvent myself and do those things that I used to love, those things that got pushed to the back burner as I was swept away in stressful jobs. 

I watched the Four Stages of Retirement TED Talk at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMHMOQ\_054U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMHMOQ_054U), and I've been in Stage 3 since I ""semi-retired"" about 4 years ago. I bought a business and ran for my local Assembly and then served on the Assembly during the Covid years -- THAT was a challenge. I've got two more years in office. I do have a tendency to take on too much and then work like crazy to live up to my responsibilities. Though I did Just sell my share in my business; hence my retirement. :) 

Right now I am working every day on catching up on so many things that have been delayed or postponed for all of these years, clearing the shed and clearing the garage and emptying the storage unit and getting rid of all of this STUFF. But I also have this feeling -- this is my chance to rethink and reinvent my life.

571,Optimizing when to take SS...,"Hi all,

I'm 67 and in the fortunate position of having enough money in my portfolio not to worry about running out whenever I decide to take SS.  I'm past Full Retirement Age, so it is a matter of waiting until 70 or taking it sooner.  I am thinking of taking it very soon and my thinking is outlined below.  If there are errors in my thinking I would appreciate them being pointed out.

My major reasons for not waiting despite the 8% annual delayed credits and being in good health...

I am single, so there is no concern about an income stream for a partner.  

There is a net present value of money which is discussed very little in the decision debate.  At a minimum money you take now can be invested safely and somewhat inflation-proofed with 20 year TIPS, so it's not really a full 8% difference you get by waiting.  

More aggressively, if I am assured of this income, I can shift my allocation to more equity away from bonds and over the course of 20 years (likely) do better than the additional SS return when considering my overall portfolio.  

Even if I decide not to get more aggressive, the extra income now will make me feel emotionally better about spending more money now on trips, etc.

Ignoring reinvestment and just looking at absolute difference in the check, if I am fortunate to live well into my 90s the absolute difference of not waiting starts to mount up.  But, that difference only starts to happen in my mid 80s and it is not overall a very significant amount even at 90.  I won't need extra money at that advanced age and even if I'm alive, my ability to spend it on fun things will have likely declined by declining health.  

And, if I am not fortunate and die earlier, it definitely paid off to have taken it sooner.  

Finally, I'd feel better about already receiving benefits as the politicians finally make changes to SS.  The group actually feeling cuts will be the most vocal and active.  And, if politicians go the nuclear option, with cross the board cuts, it will have definitely been better to take it earlier

Again, thoughts on my thoughts are most appreciated.

cheers.",retirement,"Optimizing when to take SS... Hi all,

573,"If You're Approaching Retirement, Do You Still Invest in Stocks With After-Tax Income?","My wife and I are 56 y/o and plan to retire at 62.  My pension at our SS's will cover our expenses pretty easily, barring some type of financial disaster.  We are contributing to pre-tax retirement accounts but don't have them maxed out.  Our retirement savings should mainly cover extra things we want to do while we are in our 60's and then cost-of-living increases as we get older (state pension has no COLAs).

Most of our post-tax savings just goes into a HYSA.  I have been investing a few hundred each month post-tax into some ETF's.  I know we're not talking about a lot of money here, but I am wondering if this is silly since we don't have our pre-tax contributions maxed, and we are just a few years away from being able to access funds from previous employers if we needed them for something.  We still owe the Feds tax money every April (and I have extra taken out of my check each month in withholding), so more pre-tax contributions would help chop that down more.  OTOH, it's nice to think that we have access to the ETF money now if we needed it, although obviously this is not a great time to cash out money from stock accounts.  I guess I'm wondering whether I am just playing with this ETF money or whether there is some practical rationale for saving a little this way when we're so close to 59-1/2.

Regarding taxes - I have looked at the numbers and don't really see how we will be in a higher tax bracket after we retire unless there are increases to the tax brackets, which of course could happen.",retirement,"If You're Approaching Retirement, Do You Still Invest in Stocks With After-Tax Income?

It’s an older home so is in need of cosmetic remodel but I’ve kept up the important things (roof, necessary repairs) and figure I can do the cosmetic stuff with cash over the years. As is condition I can sell for 400k in my area of California. 

I have $100,000 in liquid cash which is my emergency fund…I may also need a new car soon as mine has 250,000 miles and I am starting to see some issues. 

I took a huge salary cut this year, went from 160k to 105k in search of better work-life balance. 

Internal debate: wait another year to put in 401 and Roth as I will need to pay off upcoming tuition of 15k and save for a car.

I know most would say 100k is unnecessary but I love the peace of mind it gives. I had a complete burn-out at work and having that emergency fund let me resign before I even had a new job lined up. 

I guess with this new job, between living expenses and saving for Roth/401 I’ll likely only have $1,500 left over each month which barely will pay for college. Not to mention I’ll need a new car sometime soon. 

On the other hand, I realize value of compound interest and hate missing out on it.

587,Part time/Full time Job Ideas for a 70+ Retired Woman?,"My Aunt's husband passed away last year, which forced her into retirement. Last year of course was the worse year to retire, given sequence of returns risk.

I've been going over her financials and have concluded that due to sequence of returns risk she ought to be working until her portfolio bounces back. If she can hold off on the withdrawals from her portfolio for even 1-2 years, it would be helpful. She claims that she has cut spending to the bone and that the only way to further reduce spending would be to sell the house and get a different house that had less on-going expenditures.

606,Help...I'm my mother's retirement plan,"My parents divorced after 40 years a few years back.  My mom was a stay at home mom, and both my parents are horrible with money and currently don't have a pot to piss in. No alimony. 

I'm in my mid 40s now,  divorced my cheating ex-huband 12 years ago (after being a stay at home mom for 10 years). I had to reinvent myself from nothing, was a single mother for years and worked full time while graduating college, and now currently make a decent living.  

Both my children are grown and are out of the house. 

I had a short, disastrous second marriage 2 years ago and am currently single.  

I also have 3 other siblings. 

3 years ago, my mom just moved herself into my house without asking.  She does cook and clean,  which I am grateful for.  

She refuses to work because she's NOT ""punching a timecard"" and has basically lived off of me for 3 years. (It's a whole thing... she's so stubborn and gaslights you if you try to bring it up.  It's not worth it. )

She was a housewife all her life,  so she gets almost nothing from social security. She's 66 and also not in the best health (she's not feeble or something. She's completely mobile and functional,  but I couldn't see her standing for long periods).  Plus, she's late to everything and makes excuses,  so I couldn't even see her holding a job. I also don't want to have my mom get some terrible degrading job either (ageism is a thing).

In short,  I'm ready to live alone. I'd like to start dating again and have my privacy. I've killed myself raising my kids and would like to have some time to myself. 

 It's not looking like any siblings or family members are able or willing to help. I feel guilty about wanting to be alone, I'm not going to kick my mom out on the streets. 

She's got terrible credit, history of bankruptcy and makes less than $250/month from SS. She just obsesses over government conspiracies all day on the internet. 

Are there any government programs to help me find a free senior apartment and government assistance for her? I'm in Florida.

617,Marginal or effective tax rates?,"I am debating whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or both. I am under the income limits to receive the full deduction on the traditional side and I am also eligible to contribute to the Roth IRA.

I am 23 and currently in the 12% marginal tax bracket and expect to be in the same marginal tax bracket when I retire. However, I also believe that tax rates will be increasing in the future so I would expect my marginal tax rate in retirement to be higher than 12%. As a result, I have been primarily contributing to a Roth and am leaning on continuing that; however, I'm a bit confused on whether I should be looking at future marginal or effective tax rates.

The wisdom that I've heard is to compare your current marginal tax rate with your future retirement marginal tax rate to determine whether you should go Roth or Traditional. Wouldn't it make more sense to compare the current marginal rate to the future effective rate given that any contribution now is at the marginal rate while withdrawals will be taxed from the bottom up (i.e. some at 10%, some at 12%). Therefore, the effective tax rate would be more accurate representation of the cost/savings? This would suggest that going with traditional would be a bit better since I would expect that my effective tax rate in retirement will be lower than my current marginal rate (assuming no huge increase in tax rates).

619,Google Sheet to analyze raw transaction data,"For several years now I have been developing a Google Sheet (.gsheet) to easily analyze the transaction data that can be exported from third-party apps (e.g. Mint and Personal Capital) and extract more value from it. I am sharing the base functionality below so anyone can use it to build on top of it. Some features:

* Setup should take less than 2 minutes.
* Tens of metrics and statistics are calculated on top of the transaction data.
* Clean and efficient tables and charts are ready for your analysis.
* All output in the spreadsheet is fully accessible. You can add on top of it to create your own custom spreadsheet and link it to other Google Apps (Drive, Gmail, Forms, Data Studio).

622,Dad about to retire as only income in family. Limping into finish line with early memory loss and mother heavy health problems.,"My dad will be retiring at 65. He won’t be retiring rich but it seems like he wants to get his 401k up to a million by 70 (won’t sell any of it) and will have a condo worth around 350,000. He will have a small pension and SS. As a son, I’m very concerned dementia is right around the corner for my father and my mother can barely walk and has heavy health problems. Yawns when she wakes up, at 12 pm, at 3 pm, at 5 pm. Type 2 diabetics, muscular dystrophy. She recently tried to get in bed and tripped and got knocked out. My dad is a poor mouth and refuses to invest any money into my mothers diet, workout plans and won’t even buy her a scooter even though she can’t walk more than 5 steps. My question is, what likely happens in this scenario? What type of collision course are we looking at here?

628,Update on my UC Retirement,"I retired from the University of California In July. I was a staff, not academic. It has been a pretty horrible experience. If you want to talk to a human you have to wait on hold. I waited 5 hours once. The call back option is hit or miss. The humans I have talked to all give different info so you can’t tell which info is true. They told me everything was fine with my domestic partner and don’t need to fill out any forms and then later told me he doesn’t get any benefits because I didn’t fill out paperwork. They took 4 months to give me my first pension check but didn’t take out money for health insurance so now I have to pay an arbitrary little bit extra every month to make up for it. Why not let me just pay it off? They never told me how much my health insurance would be. They have some charts on UCNet that are approximates but there’s not enough info on them to calculate your own estimate. I did get a human estimate once but the difference in what he told me and what I actually pay is about $700/month. Suddenly an estimator widget has appeared on the website but I get different amounts on different days. Oh and I learned the hard way to always fax documents never mail them or email them. My partner and I want to get married so I’ve gotten 3 opinions on whether or not he will lose his health and survivor benefits and one of them said he will lose everything and two said he just fills out a form and everything continues. I’m scared to get married now. What’s better? Protecting his UC health insurance which seems arbitrarily and capriciously given, or ensuring I keep the house and get his social security if he dies? (I know the answer.) It’s been pretty horrible as far as bureaucracies go.

629,Can you freeze a 401k without withdrawing and paying fees?,"I've watched my 401k lose $60,000 due to the market conditions. This is 27% of its value and 5 years of contributions or a quarter of my work life. We're not even in whatever recession we're supposed to be in, right? People talk about saying how you should not withdraw, which I'm not trying to do, though I would have lost less in taxes doing so when I was first spooked about this a couple years ago. This money would be better off sitting in a bank account with 0% interest than it currently is and maybe even better in an account that actually pays a small amount of interest.

I'm paying $100 a month for my retirement fund to continue to lose more and more money when I could be earning thousands in a small 1% interest account.

If a recession hits this will likely drop another 25%. Then, I would have lost a decade of my working life. How is it good advice to say to weather the storm? You mean work another extra ten years longer than I would have needed to to get back to where I would have been? When market conditions are favorable it's pretty easy to make money in the market when everything is going up and much more difficult during bear markets.

Is there a way I can freeze my retirement and move the money somewhere without it being a withdrawal and having to pay some retirement fund that continues to lose my money?

634,How are we doing? Is it time?,"Looking for input on my situation as I consider pulling the trigger. I'm married and 51 years old. We own our home outright and have no debt. We live in a HCOL area and don't want to move; annual property taxes are $6k. Net worth is around 3.5M, slightly more than half of which is in taxable accounts. My wife has an independent business that makes many multiples of my salary as a software developer for much less work, and it doesn't take a lot of her time, so she wants to keep ""making hay while the sun shines"". I've lost enthusiasm for work, and am debating between finding a new employer, switching to independent contract/consulting work, taking a hiatus from working, or just retiring. We've agreed we're fine with losing my healthcare benefits given the availability of the exchange, though we would not qualify for subsidies. 

We have enough money saved for our kids to attend college and are not concerned with leaving an inheritance. I've found it difficult to track our expenses because there is a lot of co-mingling of my wife's business expenses with our personal stuff, and she has partial reimbursements for things coming in from her customers. We did, however, spend one year living on only my income (\~100k about 5 years ago) by directing all of her money to a separate account, and that was totally adequate.

My wife REALLY wants me to go the hiatus route starting next spring so that we can travel (she can mostly work remotely) with our kids before they head to college. She also suggests I get a benefits job (UPS/Costco) if I do decide to work again after the proposed 1 year hiatus. I'm really afraid that once I take a year off, I'll never want to go back, especially to a ""McJob"" type situation (I've gotten a bit spoiled).

I know someone will ask; I don't actually have much to ""retire to""...no major hobbies or other things I'm doing other than some part-time volunteering, reading, video games and movies.

Male - 38
Female -37
Male salary - $116,000
Female salary - $92,000

I currently have a car payment of $560 that ends in May 2023.  Wife is car payment free.  I think she can make it another 3-4 years without a new car / car payment.  I think I can easily make it another 5.

Wife’s. current retirement savings $110,000
My retirement savings are $160,000

We both took good sized hits this year with the market. 

We have about $180,000 equity in our home. 

My current contribution is 13%. split between 401k and IRA

Wife’s contribution is 6% however my wife also contributes 4% to a VA pension.  She is in her first year at the VA but really likes it, so let’s assume she retires from the VA.

FERS Pension Calculation
High-3 Salary average X Creditable Years of Service X Multiplier = Gross Annual
Pension

Wife has about $60,000 cash which uses to add $6,000 a year to an IRA.  This is essentially our emergency fund and not in the market.  We are thinking about putting half of this in the market.

Investments are mostly equity index funds like voo, vti, spy etc.

We each have a whole life insurance policy / annuity worth $100,000.  This costs us around $300 a month.  I would like to keep this as a fall back option on equity withdrawals in retirement during down years. 

We have no children and do not plan on having children.

I will more than likely inherit $500,000 or so when both parents die.  Both parents are still alive.

Wife will more than likely inherit $150,000 when both parents die, both are still alive.

Female salary - $92,000

I currently have a car payment of $560 that ends in May 2023.  Wife is car payment free.  I think she can make it another 3-4 years without a new car / car payment.  I think I can easily make it another 5.

Wife’s. current retirement savings $110,000
My retirement savings are $160,000

We both took good sized hits this year with the market. 

We have about $180,000 equity in our home. 

My current contribution is 13%. split between 401k and IRA

Wife’s contribution is 6% however my wife also contributes 4% to a VA pension.  She is in her first year at the VA but really likes it, so let’s assume she retires from the VA.

FERS Pension Calculation
High-3 Salary average X Creditable Years of Service X Multiplier = Gross Annual
Pension

Wife has about $60,000 cash which uses to add $6,000 a year to an IRA.  This is essentially our emergency fund and not in the market.  We are thinking about putting half of this in the market.

Investments are mostly equity index funds like voo, vti, spy etc.

We each have a whole life insurance policy / annuity worth $100,000.  This costs us around $300 a month.  I would like to keep this as a fall back option on equity withdrawals in retirement during down years. 

We have no children and do not plan on having children.

I will more than likely inherit $500,000 or so when both parents die.  Both parents are still alive.

Wife will more than likely inherit $150,000 when both parents die, both are still alive.  
 
Retirement goals include living somewhere warm such as Florida, Mexico, Dominican Republic. We would also like to be able to travel internationally once or twice a year.

Do you feel we are on track?  
Where can we make improvements?"

647,Are you factoring climate change into your retirement plans?,"I live in the desert southwest and my plan was to retire here, either Phoenix or Las Vegas, in the next 2-3 years. I had three rental properties here that I planned to use for income, which would be a good portion of my retirement income. But, this year I decided that with the prospect of the southwest actually running out of water I am not sure this is a very smart plan anymore. I guess up until a couple years ago the idea of this area literally running out of water seemed kind of extreme, or so far in the future that ""they"" would figure out a solution before that date comes and this would be a non-issue.

Now fast forward to the beginning of this year 2022: I think it finally hit me that this situation is rapidly becoming dire and just ignoring it and pretending ""they"" (whoever that even is) is going to come to the rescue and magically make water appear shouldn't be part of my retirement plans. So, even though the real estate market basically ground to a halt this year I ended up selling two of the properties below market just to get rid of them, and I am trying to come up with a new alternate retirement plan. I never thought in a million years I would be factoring in ""running out of water"" into my retirement plans, it almost seems comical because I was born and raised here and water was never a thought. But this is really happening.... and I feel like it would now be foolish to pretend it isn't.

So….my “kind of” new plan is to move into the third property (which is a townhouse in Las Vegas) and see if that would work for my retirement and if so just take it year by year and monitor the water situation.  The payment is low enough and I have enough cash with the proceeds of the places I sold that I could make it work.  But, I still feel like I should prepare for the possibility that if the water really does run out, or at least gets so low that my water bill gets to $1000 per month just to shower and flush the toilet (which seems like it would be the first step before actually running out of water), what then?  My retirement home would presumably be worth a lot less and maybe not even sellable, so I would have to consider it a total loss and I would have to leave and whatever cash I had I would need to relocate and find new housing, which could end up being a rental like an apartment if I can't afford to buy something.  So I think, ok should I just plan for that now while I am still working and have income so I can prepare for it better financially?  I really have no idea where I would go although I was considering Tennessee or North Carolina as a Plan B, but the reality is that the last thing I want to do is completely scrap all of my plans and put all of my time and energy into scouting a new place to retire to, and actually moving where I don’t know anyone and having to start over again.

So that’s where I am.  It’s been somewhat distressing having to completely scrap a retirement plan that I have been working on for the last 10 years to achieve, but I feel like I have no choice.

664,Caregiving and Early Retirement,"Do any of you out there have any advice or suggestions for someone in my situation, something I may need to know about or you've learned from painful experience?

I'm 64, divorced, live with my widowed father who is 88 and has dementia and short-term memory loss. He can still be at home by himself, but his condition is slowly deteriorating and will reach the stage where someone needs to be at home all day. I've worked as a receptionist for the last 10 years, but since I have severe OA (osteoarthritis), I can no longer sit at a desk for another year, so I'm taking early retirement due to my own physical health and my father's mental health. I'll be his caregiver, no one else in our family is available and I can't handle my job much longer anyway.

So far I've applied for Social Security but am hoping I can get my ex-husband's SS as the monthly amount would be higher. How does the SS determine that even if I requested it? I wonder if my OA would qualify for SSI since I can't work any more (unable to sit/stand for long periods of time). I've been checking into dental insurance because my employer will no longer be paying (I'm trying to get as much dental work done as possible before leaving), very confusing to me--I'm not used to paying for it. Since I was in the military, I can go to a VA clinic until I can get Medicare next September. My 401-K is only about $20,000 and I don't want to touch it unless absolutely necessary. We live in an old doublewide mobile home that's paid for and my folks bought the lot. Dad doesn't charge me anything, I pay my own expenses and all the groceries, so I've paid off all my debts except a dental bill. Since my ex-spouse was career military, I get his monthly VA pension which totals around $1000 (if I outlive him, I'm screwed).

Is there anything else I could be or should be applying for, any benefits I may not know about? What do you do for dental insurance? Sometimes I wonder if paying up front is cheaper than going through insurance. I wonder if I would be eligible for Medicaid? I'm in North Carolina, by the way. I'm afraid I might be overlooking something. I need to have everything in order before I retire.

I’m married, 40 y.o. and no children and will not be having them for medical reasons (can’t really rely on children anyways for care!). I’ve been trying to prepare my husband and myself for retirement and I keep coming back to long term care insurance. As of right now, I have a 401k that I’m lucky enough to start maxing out. We both also have Roth IRA’s that we max out and my husband has a SEP that has some money in it. Combined we currently have about $125k in investments, mostly S&amp;P index funds.

I’m reading a lot about LTC Insurance and I don’t know if it’s a good idea? It seems like it may be risky with a company possibly going out of business. Maximum amounts for policies, random policy rate increases, and possible issues dealing with using the policy. I’m still reading about this, I’m not too versed, still learning.

I’m married, 40 y.o. and no children and will not be having them for medical reasons (can’t really rely on children anyways for care!). I’ve been trying to prepare my husband and myself for retirement and I keep coming back to long term care insurance. As of right now, I have a 401k that I’m lucky enough to start maxing out. We both also have Roth IRA’s that we max out and my husband has a SEP that has some money in it. Combined we currently have about $125k in investments, mostly S&amp;P index funds.

I’m reading a lot about LTC Insurance and I don’t know if it’s a good idea? It seems like it may be risky with a company possibly going out of business. Maximum amounts for policies, random policy rate increases, and possible issues dealing with using the policy. I’m still reading about this, I’m not too versed, still learning. 

I’m just wondering if LTC insurance is worth it? Or should I put those funds in my personal investments/high yields? Any opinions? Thx in advance!"

681,Capital Gains Question - 1st year of retirement,"I'm planning our finances for the first couple of years of retirement, and one of the topics is long-term capital gains.  I'm embarrassed to say I never really gave it much thought during our working years (we almost never sold anything anyway).  But, if I'm understanding this correctly, I'm shocked (in a good way).  

From what I'm reading, as long as our taxable income is under the Capital Gains threshold (which obviously varies by tax filing status), then we don't pay any capital gains tax.  And capital gains, themselves, do not count towards that threshold.  So, does that mean that I could sell every asset that I have and pay no taxes on the profit?  If a multi-millionaire can choose one year to not have taxable income (if dividends and interest and such don't exceed the limit by themselves), then he can sell stocks and mutual funds that he's owned for decades and effectively reset the basis for free?

For us, I was thinking of keeping our taxable income at $83,350 or under, which is the 0% capital gains bracket.  If we needed another $50k to spend, for example, I could sell some after-tax stocks and pay no tax to make up the difference.  But is there any reason not to sell **all** of our after tax stocks and mutual funds, if it's all 0% capital gains?  I'm aware of the 30 day wash rule, but I could just sell 1/12 of our after-tax funds each month and wait 30 days before re-investing in the same thing to spread out the risk of being out of the market during a bull rally.  We're not collecting social security yet, so the ability to reset the basis of every stock/mutual fund we've purchased over the last 30 years seems too good to be true.",retirement,"Capital Gains Question - 1st year of retirement I'm planning our finances for the first couple of years of retirement, and one of the topics is long-term capital gains.

693,Find Out What To Do if You are Fired Just Before Retirement,"Getting fired before retirement is an unfortunate thing. But according to a [research](https://www.pfwhizz.com/getting-fired-before-retirement/) ""Around 56 percent of American people aged 50 or more lose their job at least once before retirement.”  So, It is not rare at all. At least not in the United States. But what to do if you get [fired before retirement](https://www.pfwhizz.com/getting-fired-before-retirement/)? 

If your age is below 60 and you get fired before retirement then you must do these to protect your interests

* If you are able to work then look for new employment. Because no matter how much money you have on your hand, it can still be short due to rising inflation. 
* Apply for unemployment benefits immediately after getting fired before retirement. 
* Don’t take your pension fund from your employer in cash without consulting a tax accountant or tax attorney. Otherwise, you might end up facing serious tax penalties. 
* Don’t withdraw lump sum from your 401(k). If you do then you might face tax penalties. 
* Consult with a financial advisor for the management of your pension fund. 
* If your healthcare is tied with your employer and you have a family, take advantage of COBRA Health insurance. Otherwise, find a private healthcare solution. 

If you are above 62 then 

* Apply for Social Security Benefits. Though how much you will get depends on your age. But still getting something is better than nothing. 
* Consult with a tax accountant before withdrawing any money from your 401(k) or pension fund to avoid tax penalties. 
* Find a financial expert or advisor for managing your retirement fund. 
* Sign up for medicare if you are above 65. If not then use COBRA if you have a family. Otherwise, find the most suitable private healthcare solution for you.

697,Early Retirement Questions/Concerns," Longtime lurker, first post here. 

Age 61. Took early retirement package in June 2022 from employer of 20 years. Included severance of 12 months’ salary and retiree health benefits covering health insurance until age 65 with no premiums. No non-compete clause but will lose health benefits if I take on new employment elsewhere. 

Decided to explore viability of retiring early as I had planned on working until 63/64. Met with 3 CFP’s that offered combo of fee only/fee-based services. None of them were all that convincing to hire especially considering cost of services. I decided to also meet with Fidelity CFP where all retirement assets are held. Services are offered free of charge and allow for hybrid approach of DIY with assistance of CFP. 

1.8M in retirement assets held in IRA. 

Widowed in 2012 and began collecting SSA survivor benefits upon departure from employer that I can collect until age 67 at which time I will collect my SSA benefits. 

Moved 85% of IRA assets to cash in November 2021, remainder held in mutual index funds. – as result was not substantially impacted by recent downturn for the most part.

Fidelity CFP proposed the following: 

870k to SPIA – Single Premium Immediate Annuity held in IRA that will provide lifetime payout of monthly payments totaling $58,314/year. Payout guarantee of 20 years with remainder going to beneficiaries in the event of death before age 81. This will cover essential expenses. No COLA rider. Break-even point will be around age 75-77. 

Remainder of assets will be allocated to 52% stocks, 39% bonds and 9% to cash. Specific investments TBD. 

All these assumptions/variables plugged into Fidelity retirement calculator present a viable scenario for comfortable living in retirement. My main concern is pulling the trigger on the SPIA. It seems to be good option with early retirement scenario providing a long-playing field and Annual Payout Rate of 6.8%. I can allocate any amount into the SPIA, 870K is what Fidelity recommended.

698,"Early, unexpected retirement… now what?","If this isn’t the right reddit for this, I apologize.

To the point: I am a 27 year old Marine who, up until about a year ago, was planning on making the military and follow on government service my career. I am married with no kids, settled in an area that I do not intend to leave.

Last year I experienced a life changing medical diagnosis that meant I could no longer continue service. I’m not retiring from the military, but I’m very likely to receive 90-100% disability from the VA when I leave in a few months, which is effectively 2-4k a month untaxed. Free healthcare coverage for life, etc.

Obviously that’s not enough to just completely stop working, but it’s enough that I will never have to make “ends meet” again. My mortgage and expenses can be almost fully covered by any amount of disability I’m likely to receive.

I’m absolutely lost. I went from a career plan that I “needed” to make retirement, to now having absolutely no reason to work. It’s not a bad problem to have, and I’m very grateful that my diagnosis means an unexpected financial windfall, but now what?

I have no interest in making millions or being in high stress environments anymore. I have access to the GI Bill, which means free education at public colleges, but have no idea what to use it for and already have a BA.

I guess my question, for those of you who are retired, is how are you managing? If you could suddenly be 27 again in my shoes, what would you do? All I’ve known since I was 15 was work and pay bills, and now I have no idea what to do with myself.",retirement,"Early, unexpected retirement… now what?

The new factory will manufacture 3-nanometer chips, their most advanced technology. TSMC’s plan to expand their facilities came as tension escalates between the US and China over advanced chips, with President Biden recently adding import restrictions to Chinese firms.

We are 51/47, retired for 3 years, and we have seen our living expenses come in under the 3.5% withdrawal guideline of our overall portfolio.

Or, is it wiser to keep that money invested in stocks/bonds and thus perhaps drive more portfolio growth for possible later large expenses, such as health needs or unexpected items?

Granted, inflation weakens unspent withdrawn cash (we mitigate that a little via conservative investments like CDs &amp; Treasuries) but there is a nice feeling to seeing cash easily accessible in case of a health emergency or a severe market downturn given how long our portfolio needs to last us.

I’m new here and not sure if this is where to pose the question…

I’m 61 and will be retiring next year. I’ve read conflicting info on taking SS vs IRA withdrawals. Even though I’m not at full retirement age until 67, the way my simple mind works it makes sense to take SS early because my IRA is (hopefully) growing in value. The less I have to draw from the IRA, the more it will grow. Am I way off base here?

Oh, and yes, I do have a wealth manager that I will talk to about this, but wanted to get your take.

Thanks!

He didn't work at a decent wage for 35 years.    He maxed out social security earnings for at least 20 years, so I always thought I would get maximum benefit.

I do have IRAs.

I have decided not to get married based in large part on it meaning my late husband's social security would go poof.   Is there none anyway?

I know I have to pay down that debt first, and I believe I can do it.  I’m writing this here to help myself get serious about doing it.  I’m also seeking support.  I respect the Dave Ramsey system, but it doesn’t resonate with me.  I appreciate your input."

746,Helping a parent feel comfortable with retiring,"My mom is nearing her 60th birthday and she is still the hardest-working and most driven a person I know.  She has always had a high level of focus and stamina when it comes to her work, all the while devoting the primary half of her life to raising my brother, sister, and me.  She has had a very successful career which means financial peace for her and my dad, but she is continuing to push herself very hard, work long hours/weekends, etc. and I’m noticing that it’s taking more and more of a toll in recent years.  She knows and recognizes this too but she is putting off her retirement because she has no idea she would do with her time.

748,6 months to retirement but having second thoughts about taking the plunge.,"My backstory is that I have been with my current employer for over 30 years.  Two years ago all employees were sent home to work from home because of the pandemic.  We will be returning to the office (part-time) in January 2023.

750,Grandparents retirement advice,"Hello! I(24f) am writing this because I am unsure how to proceed when it comes to helping my grandparents with their  retirement planning. 

My grandparents are immigrants who moved here about 12 years ago and are currently US citizen. They had both been working until my grandpa could no longer do so two years ago. My grandma is the only one working and paying the rent for their apartment among other things. She used to have about 20k saved up but my mother who is highly financially irresponsible borrowed that money so she could put a down payment on a home. She also used my grandmother as a co-signer for the home. It all happened a year ago. 
I am worried because I can see my grandmother slowing down and I anticipate that in a year or two she will not be able to work anymore. I’ve already started the process of applying for social security benefits which she does qualify for, though it is only around a few hundreds dollars now. But I know that soon enough she will need a place to stay, as they won’t be able to afford to pay rent anymore. 
I’ve read somewhere on this sub that being a fo-owner of a house could complicate the process and negatively impact how much help she can get from the state. We are in Maryland by the way. 
I am thinking that we need to make sure my mother takes off her name off the deed of the house asap even though she wouldn’t hopefully retire until maybe two years from now. 
Has anyone gone through something similar? What could I do now and what should I look out for in order to make sure that they don’t encounter any major issues down the line. 
I am their sole advocate and it’s a lot of responsibility and I would really really appreciate your help!

755,Am I calculating this correctly?,"I've put together a spreadsheet to forecast our retirement.  The plan is to be able to retire in 7 years and, at this point, I'm focused solely on the 401k portion (not real estate, SS, pension, nor anything else).

I'm trying to be conservative on the numbers in the hopes that my actual numbers will be better than my forecast, so I'm going with 4% inflation throughout our retirement years.  I ***think*** the historical average is closer to 3% and that includes some big numbers from the 1970s and 1980s.

Anyhow, with that 4% inflation rate, I'm assuming a 6% draw and 6% return on investment.  With this, I've run it for 35 years, putting us well into our 90s, and I'm getting an ending balance of $224,000 when starting at $938,000.  Does this seem correct or am I calculating something incorrectly?  **((starting balance + interest) - inflation) - withdrawal**

When factoring in SS and pension, we'd be living off income of roughly $80,000 and above until we hit approximately 80 years old.  In our 90s, we'd still be looking at an income of at least $65,000.  At that point, I'm sure it'll be mostly healthcare costs as travel and leisure activities will have diminished greatly.  This is all  at 2022 dollars and doesn't account for COLAs and doesn't include any savings or real estate - just 401k, SS, and pension.

Again, I'm not asking if I'm saving enough or if those numbers will be sufficient to cover expenses, I just want to make sure I'm using the correct formulas in calculating a starting balance of $938,000 with 6% interest, 4% inflation, and a 6% draw will result in a balance of $224,000 after 35 years.  Assuming that is correct, I'll continue doing my research and tweak the numbers accordingly to account for actual expenses/needs.

761,Transitions,"I’m 57 and my partner is 72. He retired in 2015 and I retired this year. We’re not married due to my own fears long ago and have been together for about 25 years. 

He made a pretty good salary when I met him and being with him, aside from loving him and enjoying doing things together, meant to me that I had succeeded in making a long transition out of being with alcoholics and drug addicts and living in poverty to a safe middle-class life. He has plenty of money in retirement and I retired early in order to do retirement things like travel with him. It meant I’d become a little more financially dependent on him which was fine with him and with me after I got used to the idea. I have an independent streak. 

I’ve been able to afford my retirement life. I’m frugal and don’t need much. Looking into the distant future I had little to fear. 

My father died only 3 months after my retirement date. Suddenly I’m in transition into being quite wealthy. There was one day of elation when I realized the level of security I suddenly had and then it turned into fear and anxiety. I know how to scrimp and save. I know how to be the dependent person in a relationship. It is different to be so wealthy. I don’t know what to do with the money. I feel like I should not do things with it to benefit myself, I should only try to make it grow and ensure it makes its way to my nieces and nephews (I have no children). I don’t feel I deserve it. It feels wasteful to buy things with it. I’m so used to my partner paying for everything I can’t figure out how things should work now. Should I pay when we go out? Should I pay for household furniture? What if I bought my own house? Would he think I’m going to leave him? What if I bought a cabin, something not intended as investment property, something that’s just mine? Wouldn’t spending money that way be wrong? Should he leave the house to someone else instead of me since there’s really no need to take care of me anymore? Taking care of others is important to him and I’m sure this is hard for him too. A balance of power has changed. We are more equal now financially. 

This is a weird transition. I’ll hire a financial planner, cpa and a lawyer to create a trust and deal with the dollars. It’s the psychological stuff that’s messing with my mind. Who the hell am I anymore? I was so future-oriented for so long, striving to improve, saving for the future, and now the future is here. How can this feel like such a terrible thing?

764,Question regarding NUA distribution from ESOP,"I retired early in 2022 from a company which has an ESOP.  I am between 55 and 59.5.  I understand that I can use the NUA distribution method from an ESOP based on certain triggering events (retirement over the age of 55, once you turn 59.5, if I become disabled or if I die).  What is not clear to me is whether I need to perform the NUA distribution within the calendar year of my retirement or not.  The fiduciary who manages the ESOP fund says retirees do not need to make a withdrawal as long as there is more than a threshold amount of assets in the account (which is not a concern for my case).  Does anyone have any clarity on timing of using an NUA distribution method?  My accountant recommended I let it sit still and not try to do the distribution until next year if possible as my spouse and I had a lot of financial things going on in 2022 which make it a particularly unusual year tax wise, but I want reassurance that this will not negate my ability to use the NUA distribution method in 2023.",retirement,"Question regarding NUA distribution from ESOP I retired early in 2022 from a company which has an ESOP.

I'm conducting a study on retirement transitions to provide insights into what non-financial planning companies and individuals can do to make this process easier and smoother.

In exchange, I can share some of the insights I've gathered so far that can help you on your journey, and once I'm finished, I'll have many more. too.

768,(M63) I'm retiring next month and they are changing the rules.,"I have worked 28yrs for a small municipal government. Never had any bad marks on my record. Won several awards for innovation...

Two things:

A- They gave me ""covenant not to sue"" in exchange for 4wks paid leave. They are only offering this to the 6 folks that are planning to retire. Sounds fishy. 

B- I have vacation and sick leave saved up and will be paid out about $25k (my plans are to put $20k of that in a 401k before Dec 31st).

It has always been the routine to allow employees to retire, quit work for at least 30 days, and then rehire them. The 30 days is a requirement of our state retirement system. At that time I will start receiving a pension check and still continue to work for the city, also most of my regular paycheck will go into the 401k to max it out and avoid taxes.

So this has been my plan for years and been talking about this with HR and management, and noone has had any issues with this. As I said it has been a routine for a lot of folks.

I feel like my retirement plans are getting screwed just at the time I'm retiring.

From the city's viewpoint, they are having to cut expenses due to the loss of about $1M in revenue of a $30M budget, a large customer has shut down.

I feel a law suit is justified, but they have never been any obligation for them to hire me back. 

What can I do? What are some magic words that I can throw around to help this situation (age discrimination...)

It has always been that the City may not have enough money for things we need (firetruck...), but they always have money for what they want ($250k to landscape city hall...).

(I could retire, get the payout, collect my pension, and then find another job. But at 63, who's going to hire an old fart like me.)",retirement,"(M63) I'm retiring next month and they are changing the rules. I have worked 28yrs for a small municipal government.

(tl:dr) full post here if you want for context: 

SAN DIEGO — After 20 distinguished years in the fire service, and the last few years serving the city of San Diego Fire and Rescue, Fire Captain II Royal Huff has announced his early retirement. 

Huff, 38, will step down Dec. 30, 2022. 

“I’ll miss working with the guys around the station and crews,” said Huff, standing proudly next to Truck 28 and his crew. “I’ll miss working with all the other captains and chiefs in the agencies around San Diego. It’s been a long and wonderful ride.” 

He began his fire service career in 2002 with Columbia Fire Protection District as a volunteer firefighter. The following fire season, he was employed as a seasonal firefighter for the California Department of Forestry, (now California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire). Serving as a firefighter II until 2012.

In 2012, he promoted to Engineer and transferred to the San Luis Obispo Unit in Cal Fire, eventually promoting to Fire Captain and developing the lifeguard program in Pismo Beach. During his tenure, he initiated and oversaw twelve programs, sitting on the board for both union and local veteran affairs with the City of Pismo Beach. Huff and his wife, a San Diego local, relocated back home after a family emergency in 2020. 

In 2020, Huff joined the SDFD as a Fire Captain I. Chief Stowell, Department Chief of San Diego Fire and Rescue, stated the department was honored to have an experienced fire officer join his ranks with such passion for the community. Huff was a good fit for the department, though he stated he could not get used to how large the department felt. 

“That’s part of the thing in a large department like this, you meet a new face almost every shift,” Huff said. “When an emergency happens to in this city, it seems like you either know them, or somebody you know knows them. It is a very different feeling than Cal Fire.” 

As fire captain for the city, Huff sat on three committees for health and safety. He formalized the community paramedic program and quite a few homeless outreach programs that found immediate traction. Chief Stowell mentioned that whenever Huff was on a committee, the project would always find success. 

When asked about retirement, Huff said he had already started working for a community victim program alongside a company called 1-800-BOARDUP. ""Not much retirement for me, I cannot hardly keep myself still. The board up company gives me an opportunity to serve the community and still work with all 18 local fire departments in San Diego County. We help families and victims pick up the pieces when the fire department and crews have to return to service. I could not imagine a better retirement gig."" Huff said he plans to stay busy in his role as director of emergency services with 1-800-BOARDUP and to do some traveling with his wife of 10 years. 

San Diego Fire and Rescue has seen a wave of early retirements after COVID-19 impacted the department two years ago. The retirement wave seems to be easing off a bit, but Huff is one of six early retirements coming in December. Huff stated the department is making good progress towards retaining personnel this last year by engaging in a conversation about competitive pay and benefits for the firefighters. ""If things go as planned, the majority of good experienced officers and firefighters will stay with SDFD until they reach full retirement. For me, I have some personal obligations that prevent me from putting in another 10 years."" 

According to Huff’s wife, a registered nurse a sharp memorial, they both take care of a dependent family member on their time off. She stated, “I am thankful he is retiring early, between our schedules, it was almost impossible to ensure we had full time medical supervision for my family.”",retirement,"San Diego Fire Captain Announces Early Retirement A lot of my buddies are retiring early.

If I understand correctly, bond funds are supposed to provide balance to a portfolio, with the conventional wisdom being that the ratio of bonds/equities should shift toward bonds as one approaches retirement.

But looking at the historical performance of bond funds, I don't see the value. Wouldn't holding individual bonds (I-bonds, T-bills, municipal, corporate) provide more stable growth and greater certainty when facing potentially turbulent markets?

Bond funds appear to have the same risk as equities, with less reward.

781,Questions about roth conversion.,"I have 12k in a traditional IRA right now and 2k in a Roth. I want to convert the traditional into my Roth as it would benefit me more in 21 years when I'm 59 years old. The tax bracket limit for me would be up to 89k and I'm probably going to make 70k this year at my job so that's around 82k so I think I'm good. My question is how much would that effect my return money? I usually get back around $2,500. Would my return be less because of the more reported income? 

My next question is about holding stocks during a conversion. I have to fill out paperwork and add all my stocks and percentages along with leaving cash in the account to be taken out for taxes. So the question is what would happen if I send the paper work and then say a few days later the market tanks and I want to get out of all my positions and sell? Or say I see a really good buying opportunity and decided to contribute 2k to my Roth from savings to buy some dips. Is that kind of thing still manageable during the waiting period? Both accounts are with the same exchange btw.

Last question is what if I wait till next year and market crashes and say my balance goes from 12k to 6k. Would I pay half the amount in taxes for the conversion?

The tax bracket limit for me would be up to 89k and I'm probably going to make 70k this year at my job so that's around 82k so I think I'm good. My question is how much would that effect my return money? I usually get back around $2,500. Would my return be less because of the more reported income? 

My next question is about holding stocks during a conversion. I have to fill out paperwork and add all my stocks and percentages along with leaving cash in the account to be taken out for taxes. So the question is what would happen if I send the paper work and then say a few days later the market tanks and I want to get out of all my positions and sell? Or say I see a really good buying opportunity and decided to contribute 2k to my Roth from savings to buy some dips. Is that kind of thing still manageable during the waiting period? Both accounts are with the same exchange btw.

Last question is what if I wait till next year and market crashes and say my balance goes from 12k to 6k. Would I pay half the amount in taxes for the conversion? Thanks and I know I'm asking a lot so if you could just answer one question out of the three It will still be appreciated"

785,Which is the better employer offered retirement account for me?,"
So, for years I always thought I wanted to get a nice government job with a pension. Next year I am supposed to be starting a job with the state which is going to offer me 457(b) and 401(A) plans. 

After doing research into the plans, I am starting to think my current 401(K) is much better, especially if I combined it with a Roth IRA plan. Convince me that I am wrong. 

My current private employer 

* 2% of our annual Gross Pay  
* 100% match up to 6% of our contributions.   
\- So that's a grand total of 8% match of my pay annually. I am 3 years away from being 100% vested.  


My future government employer  


1.  Money Purchase Pension Plan - 401(A)  
"" \[COMPANY\] will contribute 1% of your base wages.  The contribution will increase 1% each year of service up to 5%.  Subsequent years will continue based on gross wages""  
   
 \- I cannot contribute to this plan  
\- 3 years of employment until 100% vested

2. Deferred Compensation Plan - 457(b) -   
""You may contribute between 2% and 50% of your salary up to a maximum of 100% of includible compensation or $20,500, whichever is less in 2022""   
\- No employer contribution match

The 401(A) seems great if I didn't want to contribute money, but I seem to be missing out on 3% of ""free"" money I currently earn from my current employer. With both having the same earning potential, I am questioning the career change here.

This isn't what I thought a pension was, and this so called pension is merely an employer funded savings account it seems.",retirement,"Which is the better employer offered retirement account for me?

My RRSP portfolio has a diverse mix of GIC's, Stocks - including Dividends, Mutuals, ETF's etc.

Now that I need to convert them to an income stream for our retirement, I am wondering what the best strategy is.

1) I could take a little bit (4% rule) out of each one.

2) A financial advisor suggesting we sell the GIC's (5% return, 1 year) first, rather than the Mutual fund which has lost 17% over the past 12 months.  This made no sense to me.

3) My inclination is to start by selling the lowest performing stocks first, keeping the higher performing (and higher risk) stocks.   The mutual fund that lost 17% is a balanced fund, that was producing an annual average of 4%.

4) Preserve the dividend producing stocks until the end.  Half of the stocks are producing over 5% per year in dividends.  Many have dipped as much as 20% below purchase value, but continue to produce good dividends.

817,the 60/40 portfolio…is it dead or alive?,"Over the last several years, the 60/40 portfolio has been a fool proof strategy to achieving solid investment returns while minimizing risk. The strategy involves investing 60% in broad equity markets (domestic and international) and 40% in broad fixed income markets. Historically speaking, before this year, these asset classes had correlations close to zero and even negative, meaning the performance of each asset is independent of the other. When you combine two assets that are less than perfectly correlated with each other, risk is reduced. This is the concept behind the 60/40 portfolio, that is, smoother (less volatile) returns.

This relationship has been different in 2022 though. With inflation soaring, the Fed has been forced to rapidly increase interest rates to fight it, and has yields rising at a pace not seen since the 1980s. Bonds, which are quoted in yields, have declined in value due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields. We have also seen stocks decline during this same period of time which has called into question if the bond/stock neutral relationship we have observed in the past will persist into the future. A 60/40 portfolio made up of 60% ACWI (World Stock index) and 40% AGG (US Total Bond Index) has a performance of -19.88% YTD. ACWI performance is -23% YTD (not including dividends) and AGG is about -16% YTD (not including interest payments). So much for the zero correlation!

In hindsight, the 60/40 portfolio has not been a solid strategy this year. When we look forward though, there are reasons to expect bonds to perform more like bonds. US treasuries which are virtually risk-free offer a 4% yield right now and could be attractive seeing we have slowing growth and could potentially be facing lower than average equity returns for the foreseeable future.

Because I am so interested in this relationship, starting with the month of November, I will monitor the monthly performance of the 60/40 portfolio vs. the S&amp;P 500 and will post it once distribution data is available. Stay tuned…

With inflation soaring, the Fed has been forced to rapidly increase interest rates to fight it, and has yields rising at a pace not seen since the 1980s. Bonds, which are quoted in yields, have declined in value due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields. We have also seen stocks decline during this same period of time which has called into question if the bond/stock neutral relationship we have observed in the past will persist into the future. A 60/40 portfolio made up of 60% ACWI (World Stock index) and 40% AGG (US Total Bond Index) has a performance of -19.88% YTD. ACWI performance is -23% YTD (not including dividends) and AGG is about -16% YTD (not including interest payments). So much for the zero correlation!

In hindsight, the 60/40 portfolio has not been a solid strategy this year. When we look forward though, there are reasons to expect bonds to perform more like bonds. US treasuries which are virtually risk-free offer a 4% yield right now and could be attractive seeing we have slowing growth and could potentially be facing lower than average equity returns for the foreseeable future.

Because I am so interested in this relationship, starting with the month of November, I will monitor the monthly performance of the 60/40 portfolio vs. the S&amp;P 500 and will post it once distribution data is available. Stay tuned…

820,Semi Retirement Plan - input wanted!,"Hey all so just looking for input to make sure I haven't fully lost my mind. 

I'm 32 years old, have worked largely in consulting for the big 4 after the military, got my undergrad and MBA as well. In addition I have started 6 seperate businesses 2 of which have done exceptionally well, 1 I still manage. I also have converted almost all of my success into assets. 

I plan on leaving my very good job next year to retire in Thailand, I am already in the middle of a few home sales and have sold others earlier this year. As for consistent income when moving (I didn't bother with a 401k) I collect about 4k a month in disability and another 6.5k from properties that I'm not selling. My company I run with two people and neither of us take an owners draw but have expense accounts with regular deposits. 

Everyone tells me I shouldn't leave my day job (pays about 260k a year) as I'm on track to hit partner probably in 3 years, but I'm just so epically burnt out. My prime market was APAC and all I want to do is leave to live a more simple life. Money should never be an issue and I'll still be active within the company that I run. 

My question(s) - am I too young to do this? Am I making a giant mistake in throwing away a good career track? Should I hold out for more (how much is enough?)",retirement,"Semi Retirement Plan - input wanted! Hey all so just looking for input to make sure I haven't fully lost my mind.

821,I had a moment today,"I was on vacation all last week. Didn’t do anything special—hung out at home, slept in, did some chores, read a couple of books, had lunch with friends. 

It was freakin’ awesome. 

Came back to work today and was faced with the usual work stuff, plus we are in the process of closing our office. Throwing away lots of things that I’ve been hanging onto, that seemed important. 

I was suddenly struck with this feeling that I have completely wasted my life. I can’t even explain it.  Lately I’ve been more and more aware (especially after a recent birthday…) that life is really short. Today it hit me that I’ve spent 30+ years shuffling literal as well as electronic papers and have deluded myself into thinking it was important. It wasn’t. I’ve watched people quit and retire, and there’s barely a ripple to the organization. I’ll quit or die and be replaced easily, I’m sure. 

I’ve always known this, intellectually, but today I just really felt it in my heart. In my soul. 

Hope I win the lottery tonight.",retirement,"I had a moment today I was on vacation all last week. Didn’t do anything special—hung out at home, slept in, did some chores, read a couple of books, had lunch with friends.

832,"For Buy and Hold Investors, what was the alternative to Bond Funds during 2010-2022 when interest rates were near 0?","My family member retired early this year just as the markets tanked. Not only did his stock ETFs get slaughtered, but his ""safe"" bond fund ETFs also fell 10-15%. All the bond funds were those typical total market bond funds the experts recommend with durations of 5-7 years.

In retrospect, it seems to me somewhat silly that anyone would have invested money into bond funds with medium/long duration during the 2010-2020 timeframe, given that interest rates were near 0. My assumption is that interest rates could only go up, and when they did, the bond funds would would only go down. I suppose it is possible that interest rates could have gone negative, which would have made bond funds go up. It's happened in other countries. 

It seems to me that back in 08-10, when the Fed announced it was going to drop interest rates, it might have been smart to start moving out of these medium/long duration bond funds and to park the money somewhere else. Such as cash, short term CDs, short term T-bills, or short-term bond funds.

Of course, you would now have the opposite problem today, interest rates are rising and you have to figure out how to time the market to move your money back into medium duration bond funds.

I'm a buy and hold investor. I don't really like the idea of timing the market or making changes based on market conditions. But I suppose I might include interest rates as somewhat of an exception. I don't really know.

I suppose I am not very sold on these bond funds. It seems to me a 5 year treasury bond ladder would be a simple solution instead of risking major losses in a bond fund ETF when interest rates rise.

919,Your six-step guide to Be Retirement Ready?,"1.	Make up your mind- The first and the most important step in being retirement ready is to make up your mind to be retirement ready. Unless you are determined to take the first step towards retirement planning, it won’t get done. You have to stop procrastinating and push yourself to get started, today.

2.	Set your Retirement Fund target- Before you start investing, set your target. How much corpus you need at the time of retirement and how much you need to save to reach that goal. Before you start your journey, set the destination.
How much Fund do you need at Retirement?... Check Here (http://www.pensiongenie.com/calculator2.html)

3.	Pay yourself first- Once you know how much to save to reach the set target, before you pay your monthly bills, set aside the required amount from your pay cheque and invest. Manage your monthly household budget with the available balance. 

4.	Choose long term investment vehicles- Retirement being a long term goal, you should plan it with such investment options which have the potential to grow your wealth in long term and put some restrictions on intermediate withdrawals. NPS is one such vehicle designed specifically for retirement planning.

5.	Be a disciplined investor- Being a disciplined investor enhances your chances of getting success and pays off in the long run. Well begun is half done, but following a disciplined investment strategy works wonders. Keep contributing to your retirement account and reach your milestone in a comfortable manner.

6.	Re-balance the Asset Allocation periodically- With time, your portfolio’s current asset allocation will deviate from the original asset allocation, which might not be suitable to your risk profile. Hence, you should review the asset allocation of your portfolio, at least once a year, and re-balance, if required.

I've always saved a slice of my income into a 401k since day 1 and have pushed my allocations to max my 401k, roth, hsa and IRA (for the spouse) the last few years. As such, I believe we're more than on track over the long haul at the moment. 

In addition, we pay a mortgage (with aspiration plans to kill that a few years) a 529, and are just mildly accruing cash overall on regular expenses.

Now the question, Today, as a single income household, we're saving, paying off, contributing something like 33+% of gross income via pre and post tax vehicles and comfortably live off the balance. In a retirement calculator, if I pump in my gross salary, it has a very large number and says we're only on track.  As we're living below our means a touch, is it more appropriate to estimate against a different salary level or is something akin to the 80% factor what this is all about (I was thinking some of that was tax base assumptions)?

Ultimately, when we were earlier in our working lives, the projected ""retirement figure"" was 1/3 lower; however, our expense basis has not significantly changed in the last 10 years.

I am posting this because my dad spoke to a friend and he told him that he would get less money if he retires without becoming a citizenship first.  I found no evidence online to support this and I was wondering if you kind folks would help me advise him.  I am also skeptical of this friend's advise because he also told him that he couldn't apply for medicare unless he retired first, which turned out to be completely false.


So my question to you all is :  Is there any benefit to waiting for him to get his citizenship or can he retire and get the same benefits.  (He has already reached the full retirement age of 66)


I also want to mention that we know his payments will increase if he postpones retirement.  However, he needs the money now and so it makes sense that he retires now that he is in need.

Thank you for reading!!!

However, I am now thinking of claiming it soon to pay off my house a couple years early (have 4 years left, $35,000)and pad my IRAs and emergency accounts. My goal is to retire fully by 55.
I also learned recently that my SO  and I will likely have to pay taxes on our social security income because our income will exceed $44,000. My SO will also have a pension; we're law enforcement officers.

My former employer does not award COLA to retirees very often so essentially it would remain at 2000. 

What else should I consider before I claim it?

1059,457(b) question,"Hello all. I have a burning question: I have about $50k in my 457(b) deferred compensation account, through my Government job in California. I am currently making contributions into the ""Moderate Profile Portfolio"", which is 30% Bond, 25% Large-Cap Fund, 15% International Fund, 10% Deferred Comp Stable Value Fund, 10% Small-Cap Fund, and 10% Mid-Cap Fund. It has a 0.32% operating expense. Is this a bad choice of portfolio to contribute into? One of my co-workers says his 457(b) is doing amazing by going 100% with the Large-Cap Stock Fund Vanguard Institutional Index Inst. Plus (VIIIX). Then, on this Sub-Reddit, I hear people recommending going 80% Large Cap and 20% Small Cap. Someone else on this Sub-Reddit says to go 100% into Vanguard 2030 Target fund. I am totally confused on what the best option to contribute into might be. Any advice for someone who doesn't really know what to do? If any of you would like to see the options offered by my companies deferred comp plan, here is the link: https://cityofla457.gwrs.com/preLoginContentLink.do?accu=CityOfLaWR&amp;contentUrl=preLogin.InvestmentInformation.A&amp;specificBundle=preLogin

Could staying with the Moderate Profile Portfolio be the right choice?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

1075,The Importance of 35 in Social Security Retirement Planning,"If I’ve answered the question once, I’ve answered it 35 times! Many clients are under the misconception that their Social Security benefit amount is based on their last 5 years of employment. In truth, the monthly amount received is based on the average of the highest 35 years of a worker’s employment. So a worker who makes less money or works part-time during the five years prior to the day he or she claims Social Security benefits does not necessarily reduce lifetime benefits.
 
 
 
How does the Social Security Administration (SSA) calculate benefits? It averages a worker’s lifetime earnings over 35 years, taking indexed inflation into account for earnings in the past. One incentive for a person nearing retirement to work longer might be if he or she has fewer than 35 covered years. If earnings during any year are zero, that zero becomes part of the average and reduces a worker’s retirement benefit. To calculate the benefit amount it will pay, the SSA applies a formula to a worker’s earnings and arrives at the basic benefit or “primary insurance amount.” This amount is how much the worker will receive at full retirement age—65 or older, depending on date of birth. Workers can claim Social Security retirement benefits as young as age 62, but the benefits are permanently reduced as a result. Many retirees who have little or no retirement savings or who are in poor health may need to claim benefits at 62, but financial planners should help clients evaluate if delaying their claim nearer to or at full retirement age makes more financial sense than claiming right at age 62.
 
 
 
The upshot of these facts for financial planning is to make sure that your clients don’t feel as if they “have” to keep working at a job they hate because of the worry that taking a lower-paying or part-time job will substantially reduce their Social Security benefit. There may be other compelling reasons for a client to stay in that particular job or keep working full-time, but it can be a deciding factor to know that Social Security is not one of them.

1) Can we have 401K and Roth IRA together? Are there any earning limits to start both?
2) If Roth IRA is not an option, what is another investment option to save on taxes.
3) We are planning to move back to our home country within next 5 years, so does it make sense to invest much in 401K/IRA or is it better to start investing more in our home country?

1168,Best Reasons to Buy Your Retirement Home in Mexico,"If you are looking to retire and would like to venture into another country, Mexico is a great option to consider. If you have ever been, it is possible you have already fallen in love with it and know all too well why you should put it on the short list of possible destinations. If you have never been however, consider the following when making your final decision:

Mexico is an inexpensive country to live in compared to the rest of North America. Housing, petroleum (gas), car services, and even internet all entail much lower bills than they do in North America. The rich local cuisine and home grown fruit and vegetables are also inexpensive. The cost of living when compared to the US is very forgiving, meaning your dollar might take you much farther.

The focus on Spanish language in Mexico will inspire you to take it on as a second language, which will be incredibly useful to you and also give you something productive to do with your time. For some retirees, they find themselves unsure of how to spend their day. Crossing items off of the to-do list like learning new languages can be a great way to solve that particular problem.

Finally, Mexico is home to some truly beautiful sights, sounds, and culture. It has gorgeous beaches that rival any from around the world, festive music, amazing natural landscapes, clear water, and rich skies.

Ultimately, Mexico makes for a truly great retirement destination and one that you should put into serious consideration.",retirement,"Best Reasons to Buy Your Retirement Home in Mexico If you are looking to retire and would like to venture into another country, Mexico is a great option to consider. If you have ever been, it is possible you have already fallen in love with it and know all too well why you should put it on the short list of possible destinations. If you have never been however, consider the following when making your final decision:

Mexico is an inexpensive country to live in compared to the rest of North America. Housing, petroleum (gas), car services, and even internet all entail much lower bills than they do in North America. The rich local cuisine and home grown fruit and vegetables are also inexpensive. The cost of living when compared to the US is very forgiving, meaning your dollar might take you much farther.

The focus on Spanish language in Mexico will inspire you to take it on as a second language, which will be incredibly useful to you and also give you something productive to do with your time. For some retirees, they find themselves unsure of how to spend their day. Crossing items off of the to-do list like learning new languages can be a great way to solve that particular problem.

1218,Should I retire...?,"I am 35M, married, and have two kids under 3. I have many passions/interests, but I don't really see any becoming a source of sustainable income (nor a huge sink of funds either) and find the idea of continuing at a conventional 40+ hr/week, 45+ week/yr ""job"" to be soul crushing.

We tend to spend $8k per month all in (childcare/food/mortgage/travel/etc.) but this will likely increase as the children get older.  Our current city has a cost of living that is 2/3 that of NYC

Here is my current situation:

Roth IRAs (Combined) - $350k

Brokerage Accounts (Combined) - $300k

Roth 403(b) - $120k

Car Blue Book Value - $16k owned outright

Apartment - $125k owed on a $300k Zestimate at 3.125% 2020 maturity ($2000/month including condo dues &amp; taxes)

Other liquid assets - $150k

Now the kicker is that my parents (70s) are unwinding their assets and will start gifting us the max $56k per year ($14k from each of them to each of us) annually starting this year and my guess is that we can expect additional assets to be bequeathed when the pass (hopefully far far in the future).  Further we have the option of living in the US or the EU.

My question is, would I be making a mistake if I retire from the traditional workforce, and just follow my own projects/interests/family considering there is little expectation them yielding financial reward?  My main worries are twofold: 1) I would not be able to leave as much for our children as I have been/will be given by my family; and 2) To a lesser extent, might I get bored....

1283,why work when you have 1 million $ saving? and you are over 50 yo. what the fuck would you do?,"I m near 50 and I m ok in  my head,  d&amp;d free, and no wish to work shit job.  I have back pain after 2 hours anyway from an accident I got when younger so any standing job is a no go. I saved all my life and now after saving like hell around 1 million dollar  with   interest at 6 percent,  I can live perfectly and comfortably in South East Asia and even make extra money with compound interest. 


I know most of you are broke and I m sorry ,  but see  guys, I m  not  a USA citizen,  I come from a rich country (the richest per head of citizen) probably classed in the top 5 best  countries in the word. everything has been easy for me since I was born . no student fee,  free school,  free money to study,  free money to look for a job,  free assistance,  free unemployment benefits ... (social system),  really a wonderful  and beautiful country. I would call it heaven if heaven didn't exist in the Bible. 

 regrettably  I won't have brand new multi million $ drones and F35 flying at  10'000 feet over my head to save me in case I m captured by some  bad guys. my government will not give a crap about me anyway ,  they will say   I m totally worthless  and they  will set  me free  anyway. 

yep some people in this world didn't  borrow money and made money by doing little. that was the trick... and I learned this since I was 7 yo (when my father opened my first bank account for me (he had the signature but it was like my account )  and since I have  always saved,  and lived  with what I need. 

people in  Asia say  I m better than most of them. they work all their life for 200 dollars a month and have nothing to retire. they are all f... . Where I am,  life costs 10 times  cheaper than in the USA or any  European country .  it's like I have 10 millions $,  no kidding. on top of that,  I don't pay any income tax because I have no residence really.  I travel only,  I travel with tourist visa  and my visa says work Is prohibited. I m a permanent traveler. as long  I stay less than 6 months in a country,  nobody can tax me,  anyway nobody give a shit  about me because I m  not registered as a resident in any country. (I have a very nice  citizenship from a beautiful country ,  but the world  tax only on residence unlike the USA ) 

but shit  ,  what I m going to do.?  work Mac Donald..? flip burgers? most job don't want guys of 50 . and shit I don't see myself working low wage and pay dumb tax. I can still learn better English. 

I have several friends,  over 50, no money,  totally screwed and fucked. living in hotel room in Asia ,  they stay  all day  inside,  watch TV,  cook in their room...like in a high security prison. difference with me, they have no saving or lost all and I tell you why,  these  guys are all greedy.

 they want buy this and that and make lot of money with little. years later they got divorced,  have child care to pay,   and they borrow money. they enter in a non end spiral,  and have to file personal  bankruptcy. then they just realise they have nothing left  at 50 and they still have to wait until 65 year old to get some retirement benefits (which will not exist in the next 20 years I think ) 



 I am asking you,  what is the Future when you are single,  over 50, and you have  enough money. I have no wife,  no children,  just a sexy  girlfriend and all relatives are dying one after one.

 pretty much I spend nothing. maybe 400 $ a month for a room and my food,  scooter,  visa,  travel... really  why do you need more?I get a shower after a good night sleep,  I eat outside,  and just walk.... what  can I do?  open a business and lose all?  I know many guys who lose their money because they are greedy (I just explained here above) maybe  some  benevolat? or start a family?  no thank you... I m happy alone,  most people are divorced anyway...

I am told that my best (only) option is to open an IRA.  I know nothing about investing and have little interest in learning about stock trading.

What should I do?  Any advice or suggestions?"

1385,Questions on retirement - plan to retire 4 years from now !,"Hi friends. I never paid much attention to retirement finances and I took the assistance of couple of retirement finance specialists who told me that I am going to be in deep deep trouble. I am a married guy aged 62 and I may have to retire in about 4 years - hopefully my company will keep me that long !!!
I am a chronic diabetic and hypertensive. Wife does not work at all and has no skills to get a part time job. I just found out that I dont have enough money. I thought I will turn to some practical advicse from fellow Redditors and seeks their inputs. Here are my questions - especially to people who have retired and can provide their real life experience based suggestions.

1. What are the relatively inexpensive places to live in ? I am presently based out of mid-west and will be here for the next four years in order to ""hang on"" to my job and for my younger son to finish college in the next couple of years.

2. To what extent medicare helps? how much will I have to spend to close the gap?

3. How do you pay for spouse's health insurance. How much does it cost per month

4. Currently I have about half a million in total savings (including 401K).  I have set aside money for the college tuition in a 529 plan and I dont plan to use any of the savings for tuition fees. I also have a house that is fully paid up (just made the last pay mortage payment). I believe the current market value is about 300 K.

The key question for me is to find a relatively less expensive place to live in, followed by Health insurance (for self and for spouse who will be aged 57, four years from now when I turn 66)

The so called financial specialists have scared the heck out of me and thrown a bunch of calculators at me which tell me that I got to have 8 to 12 times of my last salary to live comfortably or maintain current living conditions. However, I am Ok to downsize signficantly in order to live the rest of 25 odd years (counting from age 66). According to SSA website I can expect a social security income of about $2100 per month when I retire.

Hope to get some valuable feedback especially about location ...I am pretty much open to any place on earth - of course a bit partial to Hawaii :) :) :) LOL

Thanks. Please - replies from retired folks would be really appreciated. Apologies for the mundane inquiries.

I am pleased with the funds in the 401k, they are Vanguard index funds. If I rolled, I would move the funds into my Vanguard IRA account. Some of the funds in the 401k would not be available in the IRA because they have $5,000,000 minimums. The alternative asset class funds have only marginal increases in expense ratios, like 0.02%. Are there any advantages a 401k has over an IRA? Distribution rules I am not aware of or something like that?

I was told I should be opening these when I was much younger and much more gullible/likely to listen to whatever a financial adviser said. However, after doing a bit of reading, I've found that it was likely that the advice I took wasn't in my best interest, but in the interest of the person offering their services.

I was wondering if I should combine them into a single one, and if so which one? Or, would it be better to open up a third one and roll over the money into that third one? I don't really have all that much knowledge when it comes to a retirement account, though I am trying to learn. They both have about $1100 in them, and I am 25 years old if that matters.

So, I have 2-3 thousand dollars I would like to invest. 1000 of that I want to go towards a Roth IRA, I will also contribute monthly. When I first started looking into the account it made it seem so incredibly easy. You just make an account down at the bank or on a website like fidelity and deposit monthly. The more I try to learn the harder it seems to become. I have absolutely no idea how to invest the money inside the account. From what I understand you have to pick between CDs, bonds and mutual funds. From there I am totally lost. How am I suppose to know which is best? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Also wanted to note the other money will be going towards starting to learn about stocks and possibly mutual funds as well.

1448,Seeking feedback re: Should I rollover?,"Hi all,

I'm in need of some retirement advice. My retirement account is the following:

Charles Schwab ROTH IRA divided into two sums:
1. Large Cap Mutual Funds - 6.7k
2. Cash (not invested - just sitting there) - 8k

But I just started a new job with its own 401k with matching from my company. I'll be contributing 5% of my pay (I'm paid twice a month) to this account. It has almost nothing in it right now.

Question: Should I rollover some or all of my Charles Schwab Roth IRA into my new 401k? My thinking is that this will give me a larger lump sum and larger lump sums compound interest quicker (right?). I'm getting all kind of advice from friends / family - not sure which route to take.

If you're accustomed to living off the income of a full time job, dropping to a state pension can be a real shock to the system. Unfortunately, that's the price we pay for more freedom and a few extra lay INS here and there. Of course, if we've built up a private pension over the years, this can supplement the state pension nicely, but it can still be quite nerve wracking learning to live within your new means. If you're planning to retire, or are a new retiree, here are five ways you can help to keep the costs down during retirement, which should be the best years of your life!

1583,Top 5 reasons why you should start a self-directed IRA,"Are you thinking about starting up a self-directed IRA account? This is not the time to think, because every second you are wasting, you are letting go of cold hard cash that would be available to you after the age of retirement. A retirement account is designed in a way that ensures the owner lives a luxurious post-retirement life without being dependent on anyone else. You probably know of most of the benefits that you stand to gain after signing up for a self-directed IRA, but here is a list of a few reasons anyway.

1. You want control of your own money

In a self-directed IRA, you can choose to take possession of the checkbook that is linked to your account. This means that you will have full control of your money and you can just sign a check and conduct the transaction the moment you see a potentially lucrative opportunity of an investment. An additional advantage of this feature is that you wouldn’t have to pay a transaction fee to your custodian every time you conduct a transfer for your brand new purchase.

2. You want to be able to borrow money from your retirement account

Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to borrow money from your self-directed IRA. You will have to pay a small penalty because the purpose of a retirement account is to save money for the age of 60. If you want to withdraw some money from it before reaching that age, it stands to reason that you would have to pay a fee for it. Besides, the many advantages that come bundled with a self-directed IRA easily outweigh the few disadvantages.

3. You want to spend your golden years in a good amount of comfort

Once again, the reason one opens a retirement account is the hope to spend the golden years of one’s life in a good amount of comfort without being dependent on anyone. With other retirement accounts, you will retire with enough money to feed yourself and maybe one other person for a couple of decades. If you go with a self-directed IRA and hit the right notes when presented with investment opportunities, you can live your remaining years quite luxuriously.

4. You want to invest in whatever you want

With the other more traditional retirement plans, you can only invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, treasuries. With a self-directed IRA, the sky is the limit for you to make investments. If you think you can earn money from it, you can use your self-directed IRA to buy it. Technically, you can even invest in something that wouldn’t return you any profits, but you wouldn’t want to do that, would you now? There are a few restrictions that the IRS has put in place, however, so you would want to watch out for them.

5. You want to make tax-free investments

The advantages just don’t seem to stop, do they? This can’t be said any simpler: you don’t pay a single cent in taxes when you use your self-directed IRA to make investments.",retirement,"Top 5 reasons why you should start a self-directed IRA Are you thinking about starting up a self-directed IRA account?

1677,Feedback on my prediction,"Hey, I have a theory about housing that I wanted to pass by some folks.  I am at the back of the baby boomer cycle and when I got places like buying a house the crowd ahead of me had already taken the best deals.  So, schools were crowd by the time I arrived and housing was expensive when I bought my first house. 

Well that got me thinking that what goes up, come down.  I figured that the artificial increase in housing prices I experience as the boomers entered the market would reverse when they exited the market.  So, I sold my house in 2007 and have been renting ever since.  I would like to say I predicted the housing crash but I was thinking the decline would be more gradual.

Now, I am predicting depreciation.  The reason I think that is because I figure a whole bunch of boomers are going to sell their four bedroom, colonial in the suburbs which young buyers do not want all at the same time driving down prices.  I noticed in my last neighborhood that the boomers who had bought their home for $30k 30 years ago really did not care if they got $250k, $240k, $230k … they just wanted out so they were low balling the selling price to just get out to be with their kids or get into a one level retirement home.  So, all the young buyer who were hoping their home would appreciate were seeing them depreciate as the older sellers bid lower and lower to get a quick sale.

So, I see the future as complex …. I am thinking that housing will be flat or depreciate while food and energy will inflate so describing cost of living won’t be a single number.  Thoughts?

I'm trying to help out my parents since I know they have $0 set aside for retirement. My plan is to take what I normally give them every month to help out around the house and invest it in something. I was wondering if there is a preferred method of doing this? 

Is it easier to just set up IRAs in their names and have them declare the money as income anyway since it will be tax deductible?

Is there a better option as to where I can invest this money?

I have already let them know that I plan on investing that money for their own benefit in someway while also telling them that if there was anything else they wanted me to put in they could hand it to me.

Thanks for all your opinions.",retirement,"Investing for my parent's retirement. Hi there,

I thought I would be happy but one thing keeps nagging me (no not my wife).  It is the fact that my friends and coworkers who did not prepare, plan and sacrifice are still working and will be for a long time probably dying on the job.  So, it is lonely not being able to celebrate and share the feeling of freedom I have now with anyone.  In fact, I keep my situation under a shade since I think it only makes other people feel bad and resentful.

2004,Can someone help me estimate federal taxes for married joint one self employed the other w2.,"I’m self employed and saving my own federal taxes and trying to figure out how much to save since I tend to over save for taxes and could be investing that money. 

I’m a tax newb and don’t truly know how to calculate them so I’m doing a lot of estimating.


Pretax:

I make about 100k.

My wife makes 65k.

My wife puts 6% into her 401k with 3% match. Her part of the 401k contribution without match should be about 3900.

So that leaves about 61,100k. And she is w2 so her taxes are withheld. I’m going to probably assume they keep about 20% of it. So let’s call that 12,220 withheld.

I plan on maxing an HSA at about 7800. Then putting another 17,200 into a sep Ira. All my other investment accounts are post tax. That should total 25k in pre tax investment accounts for me.

Our total married filed jointly at this point is 136,100. The standard deduction this year is going to be 27,700.

So now our total taxable income should be about 108,400.

So estimating 20% of that is 21,680. Subtracting the estimated tax withheld from my wife’s pay (12,220) would make that 9,460.

I’m a tax newb and don’t truly know how to calculate them so I’m doing a lot of estimating with 20%. Last year we paid 9-10k to federal on 89-90k adjusted gross income if that helps. I claimed way more business expenses than I will this year but also I’m putting way more into pretax accounts this year. Also my wife made about 17-20k less the previous year.",FinancialPlanning,"Can someone help me estimate federal taxes for married joint one self employed the other w2.

2014,What is the definition of retirement? Retirement plans or old-age plans?,"tl; dr Do you really need to be retired, that is, not working, to withdraw money from a 401k or Roth IRA or do you just have to meet the age requirements? For instance, I’m considering whether I should invest in a Roth IRA after maxing out my 401k employer matching or contribute more to the 401k. One of the considerations is whether I think I’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Either I’m confused about the definition of what retirement is or this consideration is better stated as whether I’ll be in a higher tax bracket when I’m old enough and ready to withdraw some money. When I’m 60 years old I’ll probably still be working and getting paid more than ever but would like to buy a fancy car. In this case, the Roth IRA is an old-age account. I’m just a bit paranoid about contributing money to these accounts and then finding out retirement means absolutely not working. I know I have irrational anxiety and so some words of assurance would be appreciated. Thank you.",FinancialPlanning,"What is the definition of retirement?

2032,What does a HEI do for those that have poor credit?,"Hi, I'm having a hard time applying for HELOC for our house and our credit score is poor, therefore can't apply for any form of loans.

Last week when I was looking into a HELOC, that loan officer was knowledgeable and I never heard of a Home equity investment that the loan officer recommends.

I did do research on home equity investment. I think I get it, just need a bit more explanation and seems risky.

A HEI is for some people who has poor credit and didn't qualify for any loans. It's a 10-30 year term where that business invests in your home and give you $$ for how much your home value is at. You won't owe or pay anything back to that business until the term is over. So whenever your home appreciates, you won't owe as much, unsure about when a home value increases. That money they gave you must only be used for home improvements only and nothing else, when a home gets to the point of disrepair, they won't help you at all and when you're not able to pay the $$ back when the term has ended,they'll sell your house.

We are looking at this specific area as we see value in the region and can start to see signs of gentrification and younger families moving in. 

My wife is coming to an age where it may not be safe for her to have children. I personally need to do more research in the women anatomy and learn more, but based on what she's telling me, we need to start moving.

We have a healthy nest egg between myself, her, and from her recently passed a mother and she's OK with us signing a postnup and her footing a major part of the bill so we can pay a sizeable down payment with lower monthly payments so should a baby arrive, we won't be tight on cashflow.

2040,Divorce Payment Options: transfer IRA or get a HELOC?,"Could use your help weighing options pertaining to a divorce settlement. 

Looking like I'm going to have to pay my ex-wife round about $100k. 

I will also eventually have to refinance the house so her name comes off the mortgage (10 years left on it, 2.5%) 

My options as I see them:

1. Transfer my Fidelity IRA valued at $69k + get a personal loan or HELOC. I'm not contributing to it anymore because of budget constraints, but even without contributing, it still makes money.

2. Refinance the house sooner rather than later. Lose my 2.5% interest rate, but do a cash-out option and essentially roll her divorce settlement into my mortgage payment. I could go for a much longer term and possibly have a similar payment as I have now.

It SEEMS like the better option is the cash-out refinance. But, I'm worried. Can you think of anything I'm not considering?

2042,Repair car or buy something new,"I currently drive a 2008 Honda Accord with 172k miles on it that is fully paid off. The bumper was held on by zip ties which recently broke, leading me to consider whether to repair the car or buy a new (used) car that would potentially be more dependable. 
The bumper and lining are blown, plus there is a small issue with one of my front headlights, so repairing my car would cost ~$3000. The car has no signs of mechanical failure and I recently replaced the AC, so I don’t foresee any issues in the near future. I just drove the car on a &gt;1,000 mile move with no issues. 
The alternate option would be getting a new car, probably something like a ~2017 Toyota or Honda with 70-90k miles for ~$14-16,000. I could put $10,000 down and pay the car off in 2 years with a very low ~200/month car payment. 
If I were to get a new car, my plan would be to drive it into the ground, so I hopefully wouldn’t have to worry much about depreciation. My issue is that I drive very little (~2,000 miles/year) so I don’t know if having a car payment is worth it when I have a car that works after putting in some money to fix it.

2053,I Want to Buy a Nice Car - Financially Irresponsible?,"Hey Everyone,

Posting here to get some thoughts on pursuing a new car purchase ($60,000). 

Im mid-20s, zero debt, and making mid-low $100s income. I save 10% to pretax 401k and 10% to post tax IRA every paycheck, and total savings just under $100k. I have a fully paid off car worth around $20k.

&amp;#x200B;

The housing market right now doesn't look great in a investment return sense, so I have been biding my time on investing in a first home. My philosophy is if I keep my rent expense under what interest/property tax would be on a house, and invest what would be going toward the mortgage, I am (at the moment) having better return. I think in the next 2-3 years (depending on rates and value appreciation) will be house buying timeframe. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is - would it be financially irresponsible to buy a nice car in this economy/stage of my life? I am a decently big car guy and run the math on a \~$60k new used ""sporty"" car. I have a yearly bonus incoming where I could use some of that as a down payment, and invest the rest. With trading in my current car \~$20k and 48mo terms I'm seeing \~$600 a month as a payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have anyone to consult about these types of things, and wondering if I might not be considering certain things / looking for alternate perspective rather than being rash and just pulling the trigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

2067,"Retirement Planning for the Long Haul, 401k versus Roth IRA","Hello all, I recently got a new job making about $72000 after tax and have been having a debate with my SO.

The company I work has a 401k plan where they match 100% up to 5%. Understandably if I don’t contribute to the 401k I’m not getting the “free money” but my thought was that my 401k could instead be used in “high risk” investments to potentially gain more than 10% return on my investment. I forgot the exact numbers but I believe maxing the Roth IRA with average returns created about $180000 of annual returns starting when I would retire.

Some background - a year or so ago I researched the back door Roth since I'm ineligible for a Roth contribution. My understanding at the time was that as long as I created a new IRA account and transferred the entire amount in that calendar year I wouldn't be subject to this.  I successfully did the transfer to the Roth account last year for both myself and my wife (I'm using wealthfront and it was relatively easy).

Now comes tax time and I did my taxes yesterday. In the process I came upon the pro rata rule and read through it again. I realized I had not taken into account that the rule applies to the aggregation of ALL IRA accounts you have. Unfortunately, when I did the back door transaction, I had not considered that I have another IRA account in a different institution that is a pre tax 401K rollover from a prior employer. Also, my wife had another pre tax IRA account that I had not considered. This now means that I have to either consider converting those IRA's as well or deal with the pro rata rule :(  


My understanding of how the pro rata rule is calculated:  
Taxable amount = \[total pre-tax dollars in all your traditional IRAs\] / \[total dollars in all your traditional IRAs\] \* \[converted amount\]   


Since my old 401K rollover IRA is a high value pre tax IRA (&gt; 200K) this is a big problem. I can't break that IRA since the tax ramifications would be huge. So, I started researching if I could reverse this back door Roth by recharacterizing it back to an IRA and then ran into this new rule:  


*""In the past, you could change your mind and recharacterize that Roth conversion back to a traditional IRA. However, the* [*Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)*](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/) *of 2017 banned recharacterizing the account balance of a Roth conversion back to a traditional IRA.5""*  


In essence Roth IRA conversions are now irrevocable. What a minefield :(  
The big question is, what are my options here to recover from this mistake?

1. Do I just pay taxes on the back door Roth and live with this mistake?  
2. Is there another way to withdraw from the Roth and negate this transaction somehow?  
3. I have a new 401K with my employer and in theory I could move my roth to that but I'm not sure if they accept rollovers from other institutions. Even if it did I'm not sure if it would be a good idea and also it wouldn't apply to my wife's IRA.

It's clearly my fault for not fully understanding this, but man what a minefield!  
I'd appreciate any ideas on how to recover from this mess.

I have spoken to an online mortgage broker who has suggested I will not be able to obtain a new mortgage offer for myself as a single person in order to purchase a property until I am fully off of the current mortgage. 

I require the funds from my ex partners purchase of my share in order for my deposit but assumed this was the same for any next property purchase (in that often your deposit is tied up in the property you already own). 

I also cannot see how this situation is any different from an individual buying their next home when they have a mortgage over their current property (which is the case for many people). 

I cannot see much about this situation online so really hoping someone on here can shed some light, because as it stands I understand I cannot put any offers in on another property until I am free from my current mortgage, at which point I would effectively be homeless..

2082,Butterflies for house purchase - a glimpse into my personal finance,"My wife and I are moving into a new home within the next 3 months, and I'm starting to get some butterflies in my stomach for a few reasons. 

1. I could have never imagined living in such a nice home considering how I grew up. This isn't a rag-to-riches story, but I grew up lower class and my family struggled financially for my entire childhood 

2. I'm associating the house I'm moving into with a New England price tag, which would have doubled or tripled the price of this home. My wife and I recently moved across the country and housing is significantly cheaper here than where we came from. 

3. The monthly mortgage payment is high, mostly inflated by the high-interest rate (7%). Nonetheless, the monthly mortgage amount 'feels' like a lot mentally, but logically, perhaps it's not. Details below. 

My wife and basically split all expenses 50/50. She works in the medical field and her job is rescission-proof. Im college educated, been with the company I work for 8 years and have a nice career path. Currently I’m on a director level, and the company is well positioned financially and in our market place to stomach a recession. 

High level personal financial details found below: 
We are able to save 21% of our net income in cash

We both contribute to 401k. I do 4% with a 4% match, wife does 3% with 3% match 

Our all in debt to income including the future mortgage is 31%

My wife and I do not need to earn a penny for 15 months and we can live off of our liquid savings account. The account balance would go to $0, but illustrates the cash reserves we have 

Considering her job is recession proof, I personally wouldn’t need to earn a penny for 25 months and we can live off of her salary + the money in the bank. Again, that means our account would go to $0, but it’s an extreme example and also doesn’t include lifestyle changes. We could go beyond 15 and 25 months if we were more conservative 

We do not foresee our expenses changing much over the next 5-10 years. We have kids, and we are allocating money to towards their future. The 21% cash savings mentioned above is after we’ve already tucked some money away for them. 

I do realize we should or could make adjustments to our 401k, and instead of saving 21% of our income we could invest more. But high level - does the above sound like my wife and I are doing well?

2086,Is it smarter to take a loan to pay off debts so I have 1 payment instead of 2?,"Please excuse my financial illiteracy as I don’t know as much as I probably should when it comes to my personal finances.

I’m a 20 year old student in Canada. I went through some troubling times with my car, housing and other expenses, and managed to amass about $5500 of credit card debt, split among 2 cards, with $1000 on one and $4500 on the other. 

I went a long period not being able to make payments and the $4500 debt (formally $7500, I paid off $3000) was sent to collections. Since being sent I have made that $3000 payment and made an arrangement to pay $500 a month until it’s paid off. My other card has been sitting at $1000 for about 2 months now and I haven’t been able to make any payments onto it.

I don’t work much and make only about $1000 a month, as I can only work weekends at my job. 

Would it be a better idea to take a loan from my bank to pay that off and then just pay the one amount every month, or should I continue to just buckle down and put ~$700 of my monthly income towards my cards?

I don’t know much about my interest rates and what not, unfortunately.

2098,Corvette C7 Z06 - Need some advice,"I know I might get a lot of hate for this, but some genuine advice would be truly appreciated. (All numbers below are CAD, not USD).

I am 23 years old and I take home around $4,500  a month from my job after taxes. I have $120,000 saved up at the moment, and I have very little expenses as I live with my parents and don’t plant to move out for a few more years. I save roughly $3,500 a month on top of what I already have saved up. I’m looking at a 2017 Z06 that is priced quite alright in this crazy market. So here’s the scenario I have in mind:

-Put $60,000 down, finance the remaining amount which is $48,000 (and leave the other $60,000 saved up for rainy days) 
-Monthly payment will be $880
-Insurance will be $350 (I currently pay $300 so it’s only going up $50)
-Gas will be $500/month (I pay $300 a month right now so I’ll only be paying $200 extra)
-Total car expenses will be around $1800 a month, so I will be able to save $1700 a month plus what I already have in savings 

I’ve dreamed about owning this car for the last 5 years and it has been my motivation to improve myself as a man and become the best version of my self. I made many sacrifices. I never partied, dated, went out, smoked, drank, or went on vacation. All I did was work and save save save throughout my highschool and university years. My job is pretty secure and I’ve been working there for 2 years now since I graduated university. Ever since I saw this Z06 for sale last week I can’t sleep, drink or eat without constantly thinking about it. It’s the exact spec I want, and it’s low mileage (only 10,000kms which is roughly 5,000miles).

I know this is not the smartest move financially. But I will never be 23 with a Z06 again, and I may not even live past 30. I have no gf/wife or kids and don’t plan to for the next 10 years, so this decision is a lot easier to make right now as I have no real responsibilities. Also,I will have $60k in savings plus save $1700 a month incase things go wrong. Worst case: in 4-5 years I’ll be 27 with a paid off Z06 and around $100,000 in savings. What do you guys think?

2102,Should I get a side hustle (on top of my full time job) for more financial cushion?,"My husband and I (late 20s) accumulated a lot of debt from graduate school. We were basically living off of credit cards back then (very dumb choice), and now we’re very aggressively paying them off. It’s necessary, but sucks a lot. Through this process, we realized our financial habits are not great in general. We both work FT, but I have a lot of free time with my job. I end work at 2:30pm and I’m completely off over the summers (but I get paid). Our budget is tight, we have almost no “guilt free” spending money, and very little savings. In a nutshell, life is tough until we bulk up our savings and pay off the debt. I was reading online about women who have saved a lot working a side hustle. I thought, I’m still young, why not.

My husband and I (late 20s) accumulated a lot of debt from graduate school. We were basically living off of credit cards back then (very dumb choice), and now we’re very aggressively paying them off. It’s necessary, but sucks a lot. Through this process, we realized our financial habits are not great in general. We both work FT, but I have a lot of free time with my job. I end work at 2:30pm and I’m completely off over the summers (but I get paid). Our budget is tight, we have almost no “guilt free” spending money, and very little savings. In a nutshell, life is tough until we bulk up our savings and pay off the debt. I was reading online about women who have saved a lot working a side hustle. I thought, I’m still young, why not.

2103,HOW WE ENJOY OUR BUDGET EVERY MONTH?,,FinancialPlanning,HOW WE ENJOY OUR BUDGET EVERY MONTH? 
2104,Pros and Cons of changing all due dates to the 1st of the month?,"I’m considering changing the due date of every bill to the 1st of the month.

Currently, things are due all month long. A few items are in automatic draft, but the majority I pay by directly visiting the website of the company. 

Some things take days to clear the bank, if I can’t use a debit card. (Examples: mortgage, car payment, etc.)

I feel like all I do, all month long, is…
1) Pay a bill
2) Wait a few days for it to clear the bank
3) Pay another bill
4) Wait a few days for it to clear the bank
Lather, rinse, repeat. 🧼 

Here’s my thoughts:
-4 paychecks per month
-Divide total bills by 4
-Transfer that amount to an account specifically devoted to bills 
-Pay all bills on the 1st

Pros and Cons of this? 

I know it will make each bill a little extra for one billing cycle, but would balance out afterwards. I also know that some places won’t let me do the 1st, but they’ll let me be somewhat close. I know it takes self discipline to transfer it all each month, which will be fine. 

Just curious if there’s any pros or cons I’ve potentially overlooked.",FinancialPlanning,"Pros and Cons of changing all due dates to the 1st of the month? I’m considering changing the due date of every bill to the 1st of the month.

I need medical procedures in the next few months that insurance has determined to not be necessary but are. It’s more complex than I’d like to explain in this post. I need to pay about $30k upfront before treatment can begin. We do not have the luxury of time to save.

What is the best way to borrow $30k? Suggestions I’ve heard is opening credit cards with 0% interest introductory periods and paying them off before interest is due. Another option would be taking out a heloc. We owe about $80k on a house Zillow says is worth $300k+ and our mortgage payment is $1,100 a month.

I started a new job last summer but unfortunately went on unpaid leave for 4 months due to pregnancy complications and my maternity leave. I’ll make about $100k this year. Our expenses increased at that time as we needed to buy a car and send the kids to daycare.

Our credit scores are both over 800. Only other debt is about $30k in student loans and $20k in auto loans between us. We’ve been aggressively paying off debt and saving for retirement. We have about $21k in checking and savings right now.

I need medical procedures in the next few months that insurance has determined to not be necessary but are. It’s more complex than I’d like to explain in this post. I need to pay about $30k upfront before treatment can begin. We do not have the luxury of time to save.

What is the best way to borrow $30k? Suggestions I’ve heard is opening credit cards with 0% interest introductory periods and paying them off before interest is due. Another option would be taking out a heloc. We owe about $80k on a house Zillow says is worth $300k+ and our mortgage payment is $1,100 a month. Should we take out a private loan from a credit union?

My husbands income is about $80k a year and his income solely supported us until last summer while I went back to school and cared for our children. I started a new job last summer but unfortunately went on unpaid leave for 4 months due to pregnancy complications and my maternity leave. I’ll make about $100k this year. Our expenses increased at that time as we needed to buy a car and send the kids to daycare.

2139,Sell or keep current home during job relocation?,"Some context. My wife (33F) and I (31M) are relocating from Ohio to Minneapolis. We have a 1 year old. 

We’re torn between keeping our current home in Ohio and renting it out and then renting in Minneapolis. Or selling our current home and buying new in Minneapolis. 

Current home: 370k mortgage, would sell for 600k - interest rate 3%. Mortgage $2,750 a month - would rent for about $3,400/mo. 

A new home of same stature would be a $3,900/mo mortgage payment in Mpls. with current interest rates. We see homes for rent in the $3,300 range. 

I’m taking a new job in Minneapolis and feel that it would catapult my career where we may relocate again in 4-7 years for the next opportunity. So feels like we’d barely break even at that time frame on a new home. I did get a $40k net relocation bonus. 

Income is about $300k household. All of our family is in central Ohio and truly love our home in Ohio. We could see ourselves coming back here some day and I think it would be awesome to still have that cheap interest rate in a neighborhood that’s coveted.

2141,Should I pay off debt faster or put more in savings?,"Here is my situation. My spouse and I both have steady incomes and currently don’t have any issues paying our bills. We are both setting aside a portion of our paychecks into retirement funds and have been putting aside $500 every month into a high interest savings account intended for our only child’s college. Right now that account has about $20k and a separate college savings account has about $25k. (He will be starting college next year so this probably won’t be enough but is a good start.) Aside from these two college accounts and our retirement accounts, we have no other savings or investments. 

Here is the problem: Due to some unexpected, very expensive emergencies and some general mismanagement over the previous 2 years, we managed to accumulate around $32k in credit card debt. We also have around $25k in student debt (at an average of 3.4% interest).

I have rolled $18k of the credit card debit into accounts with 0% APR until 8/2024 and am aggressively cutting spending so that I can pay down the remaining $14k by 8/2023. I would then  plan to pay down the 0% interest cards before interest rates go up. So right now I have a plan in place to get all of the credit cards paid off in the next 18 months. 

Here is my question: Should I prioritize paying down the credit cards faster by diverting the $500 currently going into the college savings account? (This would move my timeline up by 3 months and would save me around $400 net interest) Should I take part or all of the $20k college savings that is sitting in the high interest savings account and use it immediately to wipe out a large chunk of my credit card debt? (This would save me approximately $800 in interest but would leave me with no savings until I can get that built back up.) Should I do something else?

Additional info: We will be filling out our first FASFA this October so I’m trying to take that into consideration as well. It feels really terrible to take that college savings and use it to pay off credit cards but maybe it would actually be better from a financial aid perspective not to have that additional $20k in savings to report?",FinancialPlanning,"Should I pay off debt faster or put more in savings?

2142,Should we contribute to a traditional IRA or a taxable brokerage?,"I'm in the process of doing my taxes this year and found out that our income was above the limit to contribute to a Roth IRA.

He said that because of our income level, none of the traditional IRA contributions would be deductible so there's no real benefit because it would create complexities later when it's time to take distributions. Does this sound right, are there really no benefits and we'd be better off just putting the money in a taxable brokerage?

I’m a travel nurse making about 150k/year, but I only work about 7 months out of the year. Due to bad financial decisions in the past, I currently only have 60k in total of all savings/investments. I have 30k in student loans and about 3k in credit card debt. Credit score is 685. 

I am feeling lost and hopeless and can’t figure out what to do in terms of my living situation. I have lived in socal the past 10 years. My friends are all here and my parents are only an hour flight away. But the rent has gone up in all of socal. Orange County, San Diego, and majority of LA have normalized 3k rents for a 1 bed/1bath. Studios are going for 2700-2800. I want to start saving for a down payment for a house as im so tired of renting, but I’ve been unable to save as much as I would like due to rent eating away at most of my income. 

I have had roommates in the past and now at 27 years old I really want to have that option as a last resort, if at all. But I don’t know what to do in terms of finding a more affordable place to live.

I visited Florida thinking I could move there as some areas are cheaper but I didn’t like it, I felt very alone and isolated not knowing anyone there. It actually wasn’t much cheaper than socal, and As a nurse, working in California has the highest pay and best conditions, so I feel staying in CA is the best option. 

I have been debating ending my lease, moving my stuff into storage, and renting airbnbs month to month as it’s more affordable. I have also considered moving out of state but again I would prefer staying in the west coast, close to CA where my roots are and where nursing conditions are the best.

2182,Payoff Debt or Save Enough for Refinancing,"We're in the process of selling our first home - We bought at the low end of the market in 2016, and the house has significant equity: We owe 112k on the home, have an offer at full asking for 259k. After fees, I anticipate having about 117k deposited into our bank account. Our new home we purchased w/o a down payment, as I picked up a 2nd income stream increasing our home income from 110k per yr to 158k per year. Our monthly budget, before the 3rd permanent income stream, had about 1.5k ""left over"" that we honestly just had fun with.

Our home payment is gone from 1100per mo to 2650.

We have about 63k in debt between cars, credit cards, and new home improvements. We're planning on paying off the CC's and new home improvements upon the sale, leaving about 32k in remaining debt on the cars. We do this, leaves \~77k left for the sale of the house, which is slightly more than the 20% down we'd like to have to refi when rates someday come down.

Looking at the budget w/ updated #s, we'll have \~$4200 ""extra"" income at the end of each month.

My wife would like to save enough from the sale of the home to put 20% down when interest rates come down (I have a VA loan, we can refi for minimal fees if rates drop at least .5%). Im leaning towards paying all the debt off, which would increase that ""extra"" to about 5.2k, and deliberating saving towards that goal (say, 3.5k per mo) which means in about 20mo, we'll have saved that 20%. But, that would bring us below our threshold for the refi, to about 54k in the bank.

Should I be maxing out my 401k regardless of traditional or Roth since I’ve been seeing a lot of people on here following/giving that advice. And would I be better off investing in or maxing out one or the other? Or both? I’ve been reading a lot about traditional vs Roth 401k and have been seeing all sorts of different opinions from everyone so I just wanted some advice based on my own personal situation/circumstances."
2231,Needing help on retiring early. Can someone give me a reality check?,"Hi all,
34 year old in Texas. I own a disaster restoration business. I make about 300-500k annually, and can net about 75% of my total revenue after expenses. On a solid year with a hurricane (very common in my area) I can pull in 2-5 million very easily and NET at least 50-60% 

I’ve only been in business for about 2 1/2 years. But I’ve worked in the industry for other restoration companies for many years. 

My current stats aren’t good. I have no retirement savings. I only have about 10k in a Roth IRA and that’s it. If I understand fire correctly, I’ll need to save up about 1-1.5 mil to withdrawal that 4% to live comfortably? 
If I was able to live frugally enough for the next 5-7 years and invest all of my earnings each year into a Solo 401k (66k) and another 200k in a taxable brokerage account would that be wise for me to do? 

I currently have about 200k sitting in my business account now (non operating account) that I could throw entirely into investments now. Would that be wise? My business has very low expenses. My overhead is less than 5k per month. I’d rather invest the money than have it sit in my business account. This 200k is after taxes by the way. 

If you were me, what would you do? 

I wanna retire early. If a hurricane rolls around,  I may be able to just invest all my earnings, and seriously speed up FIRE. Is it really that simple?

2237,Is it too late to start financially preparing?,"I will attempt to make this short…

I am in my early 20s and my wife and I recently purchased a 2,700 sq ft home at 380k 4.5% interest (rate locked) I was more so excited at the thought of buying a home as I was a poor kid growing up and was looking forward to owning a nice new home that I bought all on my own. Recently though, I have really started to mature in terms of how I viewed finances.

Our Joint net income is about $6,700 monthly. She owned a home in which we lived in that she bought prior to us meeting. We sold the home (possible mistake) and bought our new home(possible mistake numero dos). Mortgage is 2,066 a month we split all expenses associated with the home and then pay for our own vehicles and other ‘personal’ bills. After all is said and done (want to’s and have to’s budgeted out) I have $626 left over this is without me putting any money back for savings. I cut ALL subscriptions, went to cheaper phone plan, and cut back eating out to $150 month. Obviously I have made some poor decisions and I am beginning to think this house was my most recent one as I feel I have become house poor.

My debts consist of:

Credit C-$4,200__16.50% interest__ $104 minimum payment  
(I’ve cut the card up and assured myself I will not do that shit again) 

Vehicle- $13,300__6% interest__$319 min payment

My question is, what should I do? I am going to be getting a raise of about 350-400 monthly by March but I figured I would get my finances in check based off my current numbers as they are concrete. 

I figured I would build my savings to a few grand or at least maintain it there, then aggressively throw all extra money at my credit cards, then my vehicle until they are paid off. Just looking at the timeline though and it is extremely discouraging on how long it is going to take to pay those off. I get that it’s a process and all but I just fear that I’m late to the party with all the talk of a financial crisis on the horizon, the time it will take me to pay off my debt I fear of times getting tough or my cars engine violently exploding leading me to be a more sad young man lol. We have a joint emergency fund of 25k but it’s an awkward thing for me as I’d be too prideful to actually use that money on myself as the money came from the selling of the home she owned and we have talked about it but still being a poor kid money had always been a cringe conversation for me. I want to build up my personal savings to invest and potentially start a business of my own one day.

* Current neighborhood is not the greatest. A few changes recently have led to an increase in crime - including a few shootings. Part of me just wants to get out while I can. Part of me is afraid it won't sell because of that and part of me thinks it might rent easier.

# The numbers

* **Total household income:** $180k + \~$30k in bonuses and stocks (IDK if those count towards income for this)
* **Current mortgage:** 
   * $340,000 @ 3.25% (refinanced summer '21 to pay for plumbing repair)
      *  $330k remaining on principal
   * $2,172.99 payment
* Limited other debts: \~$500/mo in credit card/student loan debt.

If I punch ""the numbers"" into a mortgage calculator (NerdWallet), it tells me that even paying my current mortgage and other debts that I can ""afford""(at 36% DTI)  a second house at \~$450k. So that's assuming no renters.

2256,"The opportunity to be debt free at my fingertips, but I’m not sure if it’s the best financial decision.","First, let me lay out the details here 

35F married with 1 teen child

We own: 

Condo
$265k value and I owe $150k (4.375% fixed) in my name only

10 acres of land
$350k (ish) value and we owe $185k (5.25% ARM) in both names

Totally owed $335k 
Unrealized value $615k 

Other debts $20k (2 auto loans and a CC) 

To be paid off with a debt snowball by Oct 2023

We are thinking about selling the land partially because there will be a HOA fee implemented soon, and we ultimately want land without an HOA or restrictions. (Bummer they added it 2 tears after we bought it) it’s not a huge amount, but it’s the principal of the HOA forming that we disagree with. 

If we sell the land this spring, we would have about $150k cash after closing costs. 

The question is, should we pay off some or all of our Condo mortgage, or should be put it in a mix of HYSA (4%) and buying index funds? Or could we do something even better? 

We plan to keep the Condo as a rental in the future, but want to stay here for the next 3 years to continue building a financial safety net. We DO NOT have any help or anyone to call in case of an ER. We are pretty risk averse bc of that. 

Pros to paying off Condo 
1. We would have about $1000 more to invest monthly bc we wouldn’t have a mortgage to pay. 
2. Saving money on long-term finance charges. 
3. No debt or financial obligation. The asset will be owned outright 

Cons of paying off the condo
1. Forfeiting the opportunity to put the money in the stock market or another investment property. 
2. Losing lowish interest rate - rates are like 3-4 pts above there right now. 

Initially we started thinking about this bc of the HOA fee on the land, but we don’t want to make a rash decision and feel like we missed out on money. 

Should we sell the land? Should we pay off the condo mortgage? 

We do know we will be debt free by October this year and we want to set ourselves up to have a safety net. What would you do?",FinancialPlanning,"The opportunity to be debt free at my fingertips, but I’m not sure if it’s the best financial decision. First, let me lay out the details here

2258,"Investment vehicles that avoid interest, dividends, and distributed gains","I am in an interesting situation. I recently left a US employer and relocated overseas to Norway. I have a Traditional 401k back in the states with a balance in the high five figures. I just spoke to a tax advisor who informed me that Norway does not recognize the tax advantages of US retirement accounts (whether 401k or IRA, Traditional or Roth). 

In short, if I keep the money where it is, Norway will treat it as a taxable investment account and tax me every year on dividends, interest, and distributed capital gains. Then if I take the money out in retirement, the US will want tax on the full withdrawal at that point and due to the timing difference it'll be difficult to credit the Norwegian taxes already paid.

The advisor's best suggestion was to find a tax efficient investment that reduces the taxable events, i.e. one that has very little in the way of interest, dividends, and distributed gains.

Any suggestion on good options besides dumping it all into Berkshire Hathaway (since Buffett has vowed never to pay a dividend)?

2259,Max out 401k or would that be too restrictive on budget?,"Looking for perspective. About me: 34ish. Single. HCOL area. 

I am debating between maxing out my 401k or not. Pros of maxing out are obvious: more towards retirement and less taxable income. I also am maxing out HSA and IRA (will max those out regardless)

Cons are if I max out my 401K, then my monthly budget will be very tight. Not impossible but I would definitely have to make changes to my current lifestyle and focus on minimizing spending across the board. 

Current budget items include: mortgage (with MCC).
Condo fee. (Includes gas and water)
Electric 
Car payment 
Car insurance 
Cell (mint mobile - paid in full for year)
Student loans (starting June)
Netflix and peacock (8$ total for both)
Apple storage (99 cents)
Apple iTunes (student price)
Internet
Personal note (when paid off will free up about 200$)

Other monthly spending: 
food (can def cut here)
Pet expenses (mostly food and treats)
Gas (about 50-75/mo)
Laundry (runs about 3$ for load and dry)
Spend/social (can cut here too)
Medication (usually pull from HSA) 
medical expenses until deductible is met  (1500 for year)
School parking (tuition and books reimbursements from job)

2262,Should I buy a new smartphone?,"My current smartphone is HUAWEI P30. It has Google support. I bought this phone on 2019, which was about 3 years ago. I have started to feel that this phone is outdated. It's been like a year since the last security updated has been enrolled for this phone. There's no more now.. All the built-in and third party apps still get updates on Play Store tho. It also doesn't get Android update anymore. It ended at Android 10. As we all know, the latest Android version is Android 13. This phone is still able to run PUBG Mobile at smooth+extreme(60 Hz) setting. But it does feel hot after like half and hour and the battery drains fast when I play the game mentioned. Other than that, it doesn't have lagging issue while running other essential apps like banking apps, note, Microsoft Office apps and so on.

My biggest concern here is the software update. This phone doesn't get security update anymore and the Android version is outdated. I've been thinking about buying a new phone. I have the money from my saving but I'm a bit stingy when it comes to spending money on something that I might not need. I'm thinking about buying the new Samsung Galaxy S23 plus. I read somewhere on the Internet that Samsung promised to give 5 years of security updates and 3 major updates of Android version for that model.

As a matter fact, I don't really use heavy apps. I also rarely play heavy game like the PUBG Mobile. I only play it when I have nothing to do. My hectic life as a university student is the reason why I don't really play game anymore. I use my phone mostly for social media like Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, WhatsApp and so on. I also don't really take pictures. The way I use smartphone makes me contemplate whether I should buy a new phone or not.

2278,Redirect investment account to pay off student loans?,"My wife has a private student loan that was set up for her by her step-dad. She didn't really understand what the loan meant when she agreed to it back in 2006. 

The loan has been sold off several times and each time it's sold, the interest rate increases. 

This loan is split into two segments:

Loan 1 - $8021.05 at a 10.250% rate
Loan 2 - $10708.34 at a 9.75% rate 

The last time I checked these loans (which are on autopay) was somewhere around low 6%'s. 

If I have this much in an investment account which, given the market volatility, is down 0.6% for the quarter, it would make way more sense to drop this money on these loans asap and rid ourselves of this crazy interest, yeah? 

This investment account isn't all our money, but it is enough of a portion that I'm concerned to lose it. Our other option is to switch it over to our high yield checking account which is 4.5% APY. 

The interest rate on these loans has only increased since I've tracked them. They started out at a 3% rate back in 2011. 

What's the preferred strategy here? Dump 'em off and build the investment account back up when the market is better? Move the money to our high yield account and increase the monthly payment to a manageable amount to decrease the impact of this crazy interest rate? Rob a bank? 

Any advice is appreciated.",FinancialPlanning,"Redirect investment account to pay off student loans? My wife has a private student loan that was set up for her by her step-dad. She didn't really understand what the loan meant when she agreed to it back in 2006. 

The loan has been sold off several times and each time it's sold, the interest rate increases. 

This loan is split into two segments:

Loan 1 - $8021.05 at a 10.250% rate
Loan 2 - $10708.34 at a 9.75% rate 

The last time I checked these loans (which are on autopay) was somewhere around low 6%'s. 

If I have this much in an investment account which, given the market volatility, is down 0.6% for the quarter, it would make way more sense to drop this money on these loans asap and rid ourselves of this crazy interest, yeah? 

This investment account isn't all our money, but it is enough of a portion that I'm concerned to lose it. Our other option is to switch it over to our high yield checking account which is 4.5% APY. 

The interest rate on these loans has only increased since I've tracked them. They started out at a 3% rate back in 2011.

2279,Having to pay at tax time,"I’m so confused. We are married filing jointly, and have two kids, a mortgage and a 401k and Roth IRA. That’s really it. Taxes should be easy, the bigger earner claims both kids (which now on the w4 is done as a dollar amount, so 4k equaling the two kids total) and the lesser earner claimed zero. We owed 3k this year on our taxes. PLUS A 21$ fee for not paying enough throughout the year! What am I doing wrong?? Do I need to claim “zero” on both w4’s even though we have two kids??

You can customize the deductible anywhere from $0 a month to $1000. I could afford a $1000 emergency it would suck of course but I could afford it without an issue.

2288,10 helpful and common strategies for paying off debt:,"**10 helpful and common strategies for paying off debt:**

1) Make a budget and stick to it: This will help you track your expenses and determine where you can cut back.

1a) Think of money as a tool, and use your money resourcefully to get rid of debt. Creating a budget will help you visualize where you can cut back spending and where you can apply that money to your debt.

1b) To get started, you can look at old credit card and debit card statements to get an idea of where your money is being spent on expenses, and then figure out areas in which you can cut back. Budgeting with software, websites, or apps can also make budgeting easy to stick with. Creating a budget can help you better track your money.

2) Consider consolidation: If you have multiple debts with different interest rates, consolidating them into one loan with a lower interest rate can save you money and make it easier to manage your payments.

3) Negotiate lower interest rates: If you have good credit, you may be able to negotiate lower interest rates on your loans, which can help you to pay them off faster.

4) Create a debt repayment plan: Prioritize your debts and create a plan to pay them off as quickly as possible.

5) Find ways to increase your income: Consider taking on a side hustle, negotiating a raise at work, or looking for a new job with a higher salary, to help you pay off your debts faster. 

5a) There are dozens of websites online that allow you to browse jobs from the comfort and convenience of your home. It does not hurt to browse jobs, and you may be able to secure a job that pays more.

5b) Additionally, due to technological advances, we are also living in a time where the “gig economy” is more popular than ever, and it has never been easier to pick up a “side hustle” to earn extra cash. Many apps and websites allow you to work on your time, and on your schedule. There are so many options such as dog walking, cleaning, tutoring, being a driver, simple home repairs and handyman work, delivering food, picking up groceries, and helping others move just to name a few.

6) Being frugal can help you pay down debt because by being frugal you are being more resourceful with your money. Being frugal is not the same as being cheap. Being frugal is prioritizing your spending so that you can focus on spending your hard-earned money on paying down debt.

6a) It is important to have an idea of how much you spend on wants vs. needs, such as entertainment or eating out. You need to Know the difference between needs and wants.

• Needs (food, shelter, utilities, basic clothing, healthcare, transportation)  
• Wants (Entertainment, Vacations, dining out, the newest tech &amp; electronics, new clothes/ designer clothes, luxury car payments, multiple streaming services).

7) An easy way to save and cut expenses, so that you can use that money to instead pay down debt, is to shop around for cheaper auto insurance or homeowners/ renters insurance. By just doing a quick comparison online, you can potentially save hundreds of dollars. Other insurance companies are interested in having you as a customer and tend to offer competitive rates.

8) Avoid taking on new debt: Avoid using credit cards or taking out loans unless it is absolutely necessary.

9) Use the Avalanche method to pay off high-interest debt first, you can save money in the long run by reducing the amount of interest you pay overall.

9a) Based on math, the debt avalanche method is the best strategy that uses money as a tool, because it will save you money due to paying less interest in the grand scheme of things. Mathematically, it makes sense to pay off debt first that charges a 21% interest rate, over debt that is only charging a 4% interest rate to borrow money.

10) Stay committed to the debt repayment plan and celebrate small victories along the way to stay motivated.

Two methods to pay off debt are the ""snowball"" &amp; ""avalanche"" methods, here are the basics:

Avalanche Method:

• Pay debts from highest to lowest interest rate regardless of balances.  
• Prioritizes high-interest debts to minimize interest paid.  
• Pros: More financially efficient, saves money on interest and helps pay off debts faster.  
• Cons: Could take longer to pay off smaller debts, which could discourage some. It may require higher monthly payments, which could be challenging for those with limited cash flow.

Snowball Method:

• Pay debts from smallest to largest balances regardless of interest rates.  
• Prioritizes momentum and motivation from quickly paying off smaller debts and helps tackle larger debts.  
• Pros: Boosts morale, builds momentum and motivation, increasing the likelihood of staying motivated. Smaller debts paid off quickly can provide a sense of achievement.  
• Cons: Not the most financially efficient method. It could take longer to pay off all debts and cost more interest over time.",FinancialPlanning,"10 helpful and common strategies for paying off debt: **10 helpful and common strategies for paying off debt:**

2293,Help with my pretax vs Roth 401k strategy (use end of year conversions rather than Roth contributions?),"My household is in a different tax situation this year than most, with extra credits from the purchase of a car. We typically max both Roth IRAs, max my Roth solo 401k, and max my wife's pretax 401k.

This year, because our tax liability will be so low, I was about to switch her 401k contribution to be Roth as well. Then I realized I could just stay pretax throughout the year and in December, look at where I want our income/taxes to end up and do Roth conversions as appropriate inside her existing rollover IRA. 

The thought is that this lets me be precise with designing the most optimal end of year tax situation, and that if I switch to Roth now and realize it wasn't the best move later, that's harder to undo.

2294,First Time Home Buyer - Monthly Mortgage would be 4K,"Hello! I am looking to buy a 2 family home in a very popular area in north NJ. The house itself is a multi family totally renovated. To give some context, the first floor has two bedrooms and the second floor has one bedroom. Everything is brand new including electrical panels, boiler, and etc. The property is going for 500K.

However, my family is highly advising against that because I only bring in $5,200 each month after taxes and other deductions. 

I know that the equity for this house would increase substantially and I’d only would need to pay $1800 out of pocket for the rest of the mortgage. Eventually, I’d like to rent out both units and refinance since current interest rates are high.

2306,I Need Help &amp; Suggestions Please!,"Hi…looking for some real estate advice and also financial advice I suppose since they are intertwined. I am going to try my best to describe our situation and hopefully someone can advise me as to how we can move forward. Thank you to anyone who can help! 

We are currently living with family and it is a true disaster. What was supposed to be 1-2 months has now turned into 8 months with no potential end in sight. My marriage has been torn apart, my children are suffering (one of them is talking about hurting himself due to this living arrangement) and I am close to suffering from a nervous breakdown per my own mental health and the vulnerable place my son is in. In other words - WE NEED TO GET OUT! 

We have enough $ saved up for the 3.5% down payment required for our FHA loan. We do NOT have the remaining amount of $ required for the closing costs. We live in a high COL area where the taxes are very high ($10k per year and higher) so it adds close to $1000/month for the taxes on to our mortgage payment per the calculations provided to us by our lender. So, if we were to use a $450k house as an example with $10k per year of taxes, we would be paying approximately $4000/month for the mortgage payment if we got the interest rate at 6.25%. It really comes out to $3,966/month but close enough. 

We have looked at houses that are under $450k and they are literally gut jobs. They are NOT even liveable. Especially not with 3 small children. We don’t have any $ other than the down payment, and we have now submitted 10 offers with asking for sellers closing assistance (2 of those offers we only asked for $5k in closing cost assistance) and they have ALL been rejected. 

No, our families cannot “gift us” any $ to use for the closing costs. They barely want us living with them. And have made it quite clear.

I have been trying to find a rental but I can’t seem to find anything for under $3000/month. And it is usually a 2 bedroom condo. We can’t all fit in it. We also have dogs, which makes the process even harder. But we can’t just get rid of the dogs- they are apart of the family and are very well behaved pets. We even wrote a letter with a picture of our family to include with the offers but I guess it didn’t matter because we got rejected anyway. 

Does anyone have any ideas of strategizing to obtain an accepted offer? If not, can anyone suggest an alternative to finding another place to live? 

Thank you so much for the help!

I recently spoke with a financial advisor who introduced Permanent Life Insurance to me. I have talked with other financial planners but have never heard of this. I am a 25-year-old business owner with a fiancee that I will marry next year. I have low debt but am still renting (I plan to buy in the next 18 months). I am also in the process of starting a sales/marketing company. Last year I brought home about $275,000 after paying my employees, and I plan on making between $350,000-$400,000 this year. We do plan on having kids or adopting at some point in our life. 

I do see there are benefits of the ""cash value"" where I can withdraw the money and never have to go to banks. Both my fiance and I grew up on the poorer end of things, so passing on wealth is highly important to me as well. But at the same time, I imagine I will have to help out my parents during their old age.

I am torn between getting Permanent Life Insurance and just getting Term Life Insurance. I already invest a good portion of my money as well into the market. From what the financial advisor showed me, it would take 35-40 years to double my money with permanent life insurance, but I would have the death benefit, which I believe was 2.5-3 million. If I continue to invest in the market like I currently am, it will only take 8-11 years to double my money.

2330,The overarching assumption about the stock market that I struggle with…,"Im very fortunate in all aspects of my life - especially in my job security and income level, that I am able to safe meaningfully for retirement. I’m not a finance guy but between 401k’s target date fund, hsa investments, and VTI set and forget automatic transfers into my brokerage account - I feel confident in my savings strategy. But there is always that little voice at the back of my mind that whispers “what goes up, must come down”.

I must admit that all my financial security of the future, especially my retirement, is based on the assumed truth that the stock market will keep going up, that my savings will compound, and that, despite occasional dips, the market always recovers to higher levels than before.

2331,When does it make sense to buy?,"I am 24 in a MCOL city. I’m currently renting and it costs $2,075 + utilities. I’m splitting rent with a roommate so my cost is $1,100 of that full amount.

$55K/yr salary + 60/hr playing live poker, ~750 hrs/yr. I have eclipsed $20,000 in savings for the first time since I was 24. I have a poker bankroll that is the almost the exact same size (cash and mostly chips) in a safety deposit box at the room I play at the most. $7K in checking acct.

Right before COVID hit, I had a huge bankroll from poker and lost it all within a year just spending and not working. I have no concerns about losing it all this time around, and my discipline and mental health is in an entirely different place, but I do have grave concerns that I could be smarter with my money.

I am renting an apartment with my girlfriend for which I pay half of; about $1200/mo out of my pocket in living costs - rent, utilities, groceries. I have to wait a couple more weeks as a drivers' license suspension from out of state expires. 

I feel like I have reached an amount of money where it's blatantly dumb to have it just sitting there. I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts about where to put $3k-$5k of this to generate even the smallest of ROI, or to make my savings work for me in any way possible? Please forgive my ignorance.

2348,Where does an absolute beginner learn the basics of financial literacy?,"I’m looking for some advice.

I’m 35 years old and I know nothing about finance. I was raised by a single mother living paycheck-to-paycheck. (The extent of any financial teaching growing up was “keep the heat turned down” and “I’m sorry, we can’t afford it”.) I never heard an adult talk about retirement, investing, different types of savings etc.

Now I’m realizing that as an adult it is my responsibility to learn if I want my life to look different. And I know I’m a bit old, but better late than never feels pretty applicable.  I finally have a decent job. I don’t make a lot, but if I live frugally I can actually start saving for the first time.

But trying to learn is feeling really overwhelming and emotional.  I think it’s daunting to realize how much I don’t know.  I don’t understand what a stock is. I don’t know what a 401k is. I don’t know what a CD is. Even things I see for beginners seem to assume I know these things.

And I don’t even know who the right professional is to ask! Can I just walk into my credit union and ask questions relating to retirement savings? An accountant? A financial advisor? 

I’m not expecting you guys to teach me these things— what I’m wondering is just, in the vast overwhelming sea of information on the internet, where to start. Any good resources for beginners? (I genuinely don’t even care if they are designed for kids/teens.) What types of professionals generally provide basic guidance?  Or even: What is most important to learn about first?

2371,How do I invest and save CAD 1350 per month?,"I am a recent graduate (&lt;1 years experience as a financial analyst). I was recently offered an entry-level job in finance in Toronto, Ontario.

2375,Keep money in pension vs investing lump sum in IRA? Should I wait to leave job until I’m vested?,"My retirement pension plan is 2.5% at 67. They take the average of my 3 highest years of pay (which is 100k) and use that to calculate my yearly payout. I’m 32 years old and almost at the 5 year mark of employment and will be vested then.

The earliest I can receive my pension is 52yr old. Here is a break down of my pay out at certain ages.

52 = 5% of 100k 
62 = 9.5% of 100k
67 = 12.5% of 100k

So if I wait till I’m 67 years old I’ll get 12.5k a year till I die but only 5k if I choose to start receiving it at 52. It has a COLA adjustment once I start receiving it every year too.

At this point I have about 33-34k invested in it.

2378,I'm lost in this aspect ... And need some advice.,"12 years ago my partner and i were in a position to purchase a home and pay it off. We paid 350k for a livable fixer-upper, and as modest earners, have put almost all of our savings back into the house. Zillow and Redfin now claim the house to be worth around 950k, and I'd say realistically we could 750 - 850 without much hassle. However, we have no plans to sell the house, nor do we want to.

Our roof is due for a replacement, and I will need to either use a credit card @ 11.99% or take a loan for 10k and use the house as collateral. 

Do I risk the house or make credit card payments at a higher interest rate? 

Would it make sense to borrow 30k to do a major overhaul on the house? In our long term plans we want to do Roof - &gt; Paint -&gt; Deck. It will probably cost less than 30, but there is much work for us to get done. Since we don't plan on selling the house, is it worth it to go further into debt or do these projects one at a time spaced out by a few years?

2406,Transfer AMEX balance vs. put spending on new card,"I  just got laid off and I have a  balance of only $3k on my Amex Blue  Cash Everyday card. I could potentially pay it off but IDK how long I’ll  be unemployed for and right now every penny counts.

I’m thinking about opening another credit card elsewhere to buy some time.

Which makes more sense:

1. Getting  another credit card and transferring the balance so I have more time to  pay it off (18-21 months). A 3% transfer fee would only be $95.
2. I  could get a card with 0% on purchases and all my daily spending on that  while I  pay down the Amex to avoid any transfer fees. However  currently for my AMEX card because it carries a balance and I'm not  paying it off in full (I am paying the minimal amount) so I am getting  interest charges ranging between $50-60 for 21.24% APR each month.

2407,whats the liability for me to add somone as an authorized user on my Credit card?,"I recently had a family member who came to me and asked if I could add their name to one of my credit cards in order to help them with their credit repair process. I am obviously a little bit worried because my credit is as good as could be. And I use my credit to help better if my future. I use it to buy investment properties. So my credit needs to remain impeccable.

His family member as soon as they turned 18 immediately went out and destroyed their credit. It's been 7 years and he is settling some of the amounts and disputing some of the other accounts that he has not paid on. He is wanting to buy a house now and that is the reasoning behind him attempting to repair his credit. I've been telling him to do this for years I'm not sure what has suddenly changed he decided to do it. Even though his credit had been destroyed he has continued to be rather Reckless with his credit. He is married into the family and had the family member he married use their credit to get them an apartment. After their baby the one family member stopped working and he continued to work and handle the bills and then just didn't pay the rent on the apartment. He ended up getting kicked out and ruining her credit in the process.

So although I want to help I am extremely hesitant to do anything that would put my credit at any risk. The plan would be I would add him as an authorized user and he would have no access to that credit card that his name was also on. So there would be no way for him to spend any money on the credit card that we would ""share"". This would give him a boost in credit and ultimately once he purchased the house I could remove him from that credit card. However I feel that there is some sort of catch to this. It somehow raises his credit score but does not affect mine? That's what he is telling me. That information was relayed from a loan officer to him. So who knows what information is accurate or what he is being told in order to get the commission from the loan officer.

 With our only tie being One credit card I would have control over is there any sort of liability I would face? I would like to help him but knowing his history I do not trust that he would actually stay true to his word and keep his credit score up.

2417,looking for advice on how to approach finances with my partner,"My partner (27m) and I (25f) have been together for almost 6 years.

I make $80,000 USD: match my employers 401k (6%/3%), max out my HSA contributions, planning for $3000 towards my Roth IRA, and put away $400/month towards savings. With my current employer, I'm not vested until 2 years and it's only been 3.5 months. Also have ~$4500 in a 403b from previous employer, they were fully vested as soon as I started my contributions

I talked to my partner about it as well and he said he has $18k saved. I probed more and it's not even in a savings account, it's sitting in his checking account. I asked him about him moving some of it to a HYSA, but he didn't seem interested, this was around the time I opened my account with Ally about a month or so ago.

My husband and I have two toddlers, husband has the sole income under 40k a year.

The mortgage is husband's only debt, and he has a credit score of 800.

Some options we've discussed:
Opening an investment account
Making a down payment on a second house to rent out

2455,Can my 401K help me with high interest debt and student loans?,"Is there ever a situation where it makes sense to cash out a 401K early? Say, in order to pay off high interest debt? 

I’m in my mid 30s. I have a family. I owe just under $100K on my home. I’m currently in graduate school and will make $200-$300K annually once I graduate. I will likely have close to $300K in student loan debt when I’m done with school. (Some of that is from undergrad.)

Unfortunately, we also have somewhere between $20-$30K in credit card debt. This is a tough subject as a big portion of this debt was hidden from me. I didn’t find out about it until a I was already in grad school and no longer working. 

Monthly credit card payments are now high enough that I’m having to rely almost completely on student loans to live while I’m in school full time.

She has these bills (rounded up) monthly:

Mortgage and all fees- $1200

Cable + Wifi- $250

Transport to and from work- $150 (she doesn't drive &amp; relies on cabs. public transport is non existent.)

Groceries/needs- $250- $300 

Pets- $100

Other/debt repayments- $250

Obviously that's very tight. Now here's the predicament 

She owns a house in a very desirable town. It's a mountain town and a very high cost of living area. If her house didn't have issues and was in nice condition she could probably sell it for close to 700k. She owes just over 100k on it, and we could most likely sell her house for 400k-550k. Probably closer to the 450k area as she hasn't done any maintenance, and the house has a looooooooot of issues.  As it stands now, it would have to be a cash sale as it's unlivable in some aspects, and probably couldn't be financed by someone. I personally have paid about $1000 for a plumber and bills in the last 4 weeks because she regularly has less than $100 to her name, and the winter has made her pipes burst and flood more than 4 times this year leaving her with no running water for days.

We have no family money, she has no retirement accounts or any safety nets to fall back on. I am just shy of 30 and make decent enough money, but I am also full time in school pursuing my degree, and about to move out of the hometown where this house is located.

Please advice a plan to kill my debt.

I am 43yo and single earner in NJ making around 142k before taxes.

Only contribution that's going out of my paycheck is 150$ for 401k with match of 250$ from my comp, plus around 500$ goes in ESPP (15% discount).

I've saved around 10k for my elder one (8th grader) in UTMA and 7k for (2nd grader) in UTMA, plus my 401k stand at around: 65k as of today.

Every month I am trying to kill my debt but believe it or not I feel I am at the same place.

Can anyone helo me with some sort of plan to kill the debts as well as to grow the wealth peacefully. For 401k Loans it's for helping my extended family during covid times as they ran out of money and dental plan is for my elder one. Credit cards are primary household, because rents have gone up from 1500$ to 2200$ now and grocery and another expense net around 4 to 4.25k/month plus recently I booked a trip for my family almost after 5yr of staying home that costed me 6.5k.

I am putting money in ESPP as they are 15% discount and I've around 4k parked there which I can withdraw anytime I like (income will be clubbed in the year I bought them if I sale &lt;1yr).

I can share any other details (saving, expenses etc) you need to help me out.

I am not having any other major expense spart from kids education plan at the moment and of course with this kind of pay I don't think so I can every buy home.

Thanks a lot, you are awesome Buddy :-)",FinancialPlanning,"Consolidating all of my Loan Payments Hi there,

Please advice a plan to kill my debt.

I am 43yo and single earner in NJ making around 142k before taxes.

Only contribution that's going out of my paycheck is 150$ for 401k with match of 250$ from my comp, plus around 500$ goes in ESPP (15% discount).

I've saved around 10k for my elder one (8th grader) in UTMA and 7k for (2nd grader) in UTMA, plus my 401k stand at around: 65k as of today.

Every month I am trying to kill my debt but believe it or not I feel I am at the same place.

Can anyone helo me with some sort of plan to kill the debts as well as to grow the wealth peacefully. For 401k Loans it's for helping my extended family during covid times as they ran out of money and dental plan is for my elder one. Credit cards are primary household, because rents have gone up from 1500$ to 2200$ now and grocery and another expense net around 4 to 4.25k/month plus recently I booked a trip for my family almost after 5yr of staying home that costed me 6.5k.

I am putting money in ESPP as they are 15% discount and I've around 4k parked there which I can withdraw anytime I like (income will be clubbed in the year I bought them if I sale &lt;1yr).

I can share any other details (saving, expenses etc) you need to help me out.

**Key Stats:**

* 24% International Stocks: Fidelity Total International Index (FTIHX)
* 15% US Bonds: Fidelity US Bond Index (FXNAX)
* 5% International Bonds: Fidelity International Bond Index (FBIIX)

**Details**:

* In terms of Fund Placement Optimization, I have all Bonds held in 401k and prioritize International Equities in my Taxable Account to the extent that I can.
* I max out my 401k &amp; 2 backdoor Roth IRAs each year (wife and myself). I also do additional investing in a brokerage account when possible with the goal to invest $70k/year in new money overall.
* I donate my highest appreciated securities in my taxable brokerage account to my DAF annually and repurchase new equities with cash otherwise given to charity to step up my basis and limit capital gains in the future.
* I rebalance based on the above model annually.

**Questions**:

* Feedback on the current 80% Stocks vs 20% Bond Split with \~10 year horizon? This is based on a Personal Financial Plan that Vanguard developed for me that calls for changing to 75/25 next year (9 to 6 years out from retirement).
* Thoughts on doing Paul Merriman 4 Fund? His walk through and research seems compelling even though it introduces a little complexity to manage 4 Funds @ 25% vs just doing the Total US Stock Market Index.

* In addition to my $1.265 million invested assets above, I also am a shareholder in a private company that likely will IPO in the next few years.

I am very careful with loans, so my score was so low due to not really having credit and getting hit by every missed payment. My payment history is 98% 😅 but with no credit really built even a few missed / forgotten payments can hit hard.

I can't find help online, so maybe you 700+ credit saavy folk can help.

I'll have 1000.00 from tax refund to pay down some debts, and wanted to know if I get more points paying all 1k to a big bill, say my loans, or if I get more points paying say 100-150.00 on each item?

Should I just pay my derogatives a little each?

My credit rating is super tender, because I have small established credit; so every significant enough change to my balances could be 8-15pts per item.

I think I can easily get 60-80pts at this time if I pay right. Any tips? 🤔

Given my goals, would y’all recommend just continuing to put everything into my savings  or would it be wise to put a certain percent of my paycheck into those investments accounts?"

2501,I’ve accrued quite a bit of credit card debt and am considering debt consolidation,"[**QUESTION**]I’ve (31m) recently run into problems with credit card debt that has accumulated to the point to where all of the monthly payments combined are becoming overwhelming. I’m not a financial-minded person, in all honesty, I’m a musician and my brain really has no interest in world events and politics. I bring this up only because in retrospect of the past couple of years, “inflation” has been a particularly hot buzz-word around the world and a lot of my problems I feel stem from that.

10 years ago, I made relatively the same amount of money I do now working in a music store as my 9-5 and I love it, I supplement my income as a professional free-lance audio engineer and composer, I get to live my dream and it’s been great. However, that being the case, some years are better than others financially, but doing all of this I’ve been able to support myself with a vehicle that’s paid off (bought new) and have food in the fridge with a roof over my head.

In the past couple of years though, I’ve noticed as prices have gone up on nearly EVERYTHING, what once used to be a $50 weekly grocery run has now skyrocketed to to a weekly $125 at LEAST. Gas has gone up and overall my rent and insurance plans have all increased at least $80! As a single guy, all of that adds up and I’ve had to rely on my credit cards to help me stay afloat. I’ve taken measures to help alleviate monthly costs, (cancelling subscriptions, buying cheaper groceries and securing a raise at my 9-5 while increasing my free-lance rates) but these changes will take time to make a difference and the damage has already been done. 

One of the endeavors I’m looking to embark on is consolidating my accrued credit card debt with my bank, but I’m naive in how this process works and what it entails of. What I’m HOPING for is to take the nearly $300 a month I’m spending on separate credit card payments and bring that cost down to something a bit more manageable. My question to you all is this: 

Will this decision give me the aforementioned outcome I’m seeking? How does it work and will my credit score be affected? What do banks look for when beginning a process such as this?

My husband (32) and I (26) make too much a year to contribute to a Roth IRA, but I’ve been reading about doing a back door Roth IRA but can’t figure out how to avoid the tax from moving the money from the traditional to Roth IRA. Can anyone explain the loophole to me?

Also looking for advice on how much to be contributing to my 401k. In the past I never had a job that allowed me to invest in a 401k so my husband and I decided to have him contribute 20% (match included)to his so it would be enough to cover both of us in retirement. He currently has over 150k in his retirement account.

Should we reduce my husband’s 401k contributions to just his match (6% match) and start having me contribute 20% (match included) to catch my 401k up. We could also max out my 401k for the next few years if that makes sense.

The problem is in my current situation . I have no income besides the yield generated from my Tbills around 18k a year. I am living very frugal manner which I don't like at the moment. Have about 40k in emergency fund, but if I want to travel on the low end with monthly expenses it's about 30k a year. If I don't travel It's about 20k a year to live.

I think the market is going to keep going down for the next decade so I am reluctant to move out of Tbills. I can't hold cash forever though because of inflation. Or can I at these interest rates?

I was looking at moving the Tbills after maturity into the 3 fund port (VTI,BND, VXUS) getting a small dividend 2%, and letting the portfolio grow over time. I will be very strapped for cash if I do this at only $8700 a year in income, but I will be invested. Another option is to go to the fixed income route in stocks and get about 3.5% yield with SCHD, VNQ, ETC...

This is confusing to me because most of the vanguard or investing sites show you how to allocate when you want to retire or at a certain age group, but what if you are retired at a young age what do you do? How do you allocate if that's the case?

My goal is to try and generate income while keeping my portfolio intact."

2526,Any investing advice for a 23 year old?,"I am a 23-year-old who currently earns around $85,000 per year. I have saved a little over $40,000 in the bank, mostly while pursuing my bachelor's and master's degrees. My biggest expense is my car, which I financed for $38,000 with a 0.90% APR last year. I still owe $32,000, which I plan to pay off in 2 to 3 years. I currently live with my parents, who kindly allow me to stay with them without paying rent. I am considering moving out on my own, but that won't happen for another four years at least. 

Now that I have a stable job, I'm interested in investing my money for retirement. My plan is to put 80 to 90 percent of my $40,000 savings into a high-yield savings account. I'm thinking of investing the rest, along with a significant portion of my monthly income, in treasury bonds and index mutual funds. I recently read ""The Elements of Investing"" by B. Malkiel and C. Ellis, which suggests maintaining a 60/40 ratio of stocks to bonds on an annual basis. I'm considering following this strategy but would love to learn more from experienced savers first. Are there any better strategies for saving with compound interest? Should I consider opening a CD account instead or something else entirely?

2559,How to plan for retirement when unsure about yearly expenses,"Most of the literature I read about financial security during early retirement (or retirement in general) usually involve formulas that take into account spending habits/ yearly expense to determine whether one's nest egg is enough for retirement based on lifestyle.

I've mostly worked overseas as an expat so I haven't had to pay for many of the things I would pay for in the States (housing, utilities, insurance) I recently got married and my wife is also an expat. We have taken advantage of our opportunities by maximizing our savings and investing most of our income, to the point that I'm now thinking about the feasibility of early retirement. The tricky part is I don't have a good sense of what our yearly expenses could be once we are no longer working as expats.

This leads to my question as I explore the possibility of early retirement. Because most of our major expenses were covered these past several years (and will continue to be for the foreseeable future) , it's hard to gauge what our yearly expenses might look like. 

I've looked up data online about cost of living in various cities in the US and I imagine I can use that as a gauge. I've also talked to friends in various cities to get a sense about their general expenditures but I'm wondering if anyone here has other ideas for how I can assess the viability of early retirement and plan more intentionally for it.

Some info that might be helpful.

I'm 38. Wife is 31. NW is around USD 880k.

Expenses, as mentioned, are quite low. We maybe spend 1,000-1,200 USD a month. Net income depends on the country where we work. It ranges from 10-15k USD/ month and we save/ invest most of it.

In terms of lifestyle, again this is tricky. We do eat out and travel quite a bit but we tend to do so in countries where cost of living is quite cheap and travel opportunities are easy to come by. Every time we visit family in the states, we enjoy cooking since we have access to grocery items we don’t always have overseas.

Timeline I’m thinking of for early retirement might be in 5-7 years. 

We don’t own a place in the US at the moment and aren’t too keen about the idea of buying a place. But we could consider it.

I'm 38. Wife is 31. NW is around USD 880k.

Expenses, as mentioned, are quite low. We maybe spend 1,000-1,200 USD a month. Net income depends on the country where we work. It ranges from 10-15k USD/ month and we save/ invest most of it.

In terms of lifestyle, again this is tricky. We do eat out and travel quite a bit but we tend to do so in countries where cost of living is quite cheap and travel opportunities are easy to come by. Every time we visit family in the states, we enjoy cooking since we have access to grocery items we don’t always have overseas.

Timeline I’m thinking of for early retirement might be in 5-7 years. 

We don’t own a place in the US at the moment and aren’t too keen about the idea of buying a place. But we could consider it.

TLDR: because of our jobs, we haven’t gotten a sense of what our yearly expenses might look like. Trying to think of how to analyze feasibility of retiring in the next 5-7 years."

2567,Purchasing a car - Finance or use line of credit with higher rate?,"Hi there,

First time poster here. 

My wife and I are looking to purchase a car. (We are in Canada). A lot of financing rates right now are varying around 5.5-8.9% from what I have seen from several dealerships. We also have a line of credit available to us that we would be able to use to pay for the vehicle almost outright but the interest rate on the LoC is 11.19% because of all the rate hikes from the federal govt to curb inflation. 

My thought is that if we pay it on our LoC we can pay as much as we want, when we want? We are both educators so we don’t make nearly as much money in the summer months. Also, if we take out another loan when we already have a registered LoC, that is one less ding on our financials/credit score?

I am wondering if there is any other unknown benefit that I may be missing to doing this? I am aware I would probably be paying more interest on the LoC. 

Basics of what we are looking at;
Suv: around 55000.

I am not incredibly literate when it comes to car financing so I appreciate any advice given. Please and thank yous in advance.",FinancialPlanning,"Purchasing a car - Finance or use line of credit with higher rate? Hi there,

2571,Financially Makes Sense to Switch to Solar?," 

Is it financial correct to go solar? Let's try to consider all factors at the current moment.

Lets say it costs someone $35,000 to go solar for 100% offput on their current bill. (The bill will still be like $10 fixed rate) They do get rebates that end up making the purchase come out to $22,000 after incentives within 18 months.

Lets say their current power bill is avg $110 a month. Let's say inflation is atleast at a 3% annual rate and electric company will increase electric rates as well but unknown amount.

Also solar panels decrease in power production .5% a year, so they degrade. There is a 25 yr performance guarentee so lets say no cost of maintenance for this time. But guaranteed to be at 87.5% percent output in 25 years. It increases the home for resale value 4.1% but could increase home insurance rates around $175 at current rates.

Does this make sense to pay cash and go solar from a financial investment time pay-off perspective rather investing the let's just say $22,000 in a investment account at a 6% (or whatever) growth? Is there ever a point where there is a pay off period?

Now let's say they can take out a 26.5 yr loan making the payment about $199 a month. Don't have to start making loan payments until 18 months in so actually only making 25 yrs of payments. (Also keep in mind even though the payment becomes $199 they are getting (actually increases to $16,000 incentives when you take out a loan instead of $13,000 when paying cash) in federal tax and other cash incentives to switch within the first year, I am not sure if that decreases the face amount of the loan or payoff period...There are other loans too 10 yr 3yr with different fees and interest rates.

My FIL has a DC plan from a union job he left over a decade ago. In filling out the paper work for the direct rollover they had an ""insert"" of a policy change effectively restricting how the funds are withdrawn in lumpsums and direct roll overs. Effectively you mail in the paper work, assuming they get it before the 15th of that month, they will ""process"" it some time in the following 2 calendar months (i.e. they receive before Feb 15th, they will potentially not mail the rollover until April 30th). Furthermore, they will only release 85% of the balance at that time.

My FIL has a DC plan from a union job he left over a decade ago. In filling out the paper work for the direct rollover they had an ""insert"" of a policy change effectively restricting how the funds are withdrawn in lumpsums and direct roll overs. Effectively you mail in the paper work, assuming they get it before the 15th of that month, they will ""process"" it some time in the following 2 calendar months (i.e. they receive before Feb 15th, they will potentially not mail the rollover until April 30th). Furthermore, they will only release 85% of the balance at that time. The remaining funds will be ""disbursed after the close of the next calendar quarter"" which puts us into July or later depending on how you read that.

2600,"Asked ChatGPT ""What's the best way to grow credit with a credit card?"" is it valid advice?","GPT - ""There are several ways to grow your credit with a credit card. Here are some tips:

Make on-time payments: Pay your credit card bills on time every month to avoid late fees and negative marks on your credit report.

Keep your balance low: Try to keep your credit utilization ratio (the amount of credit you're using compared to your total credit limit) below 30%. A high utilization ratio can negatively impact your credit score.

Use your card regularly: Using your credit card regularly and responsibly can help you build a positive credit history.

Don't apply for too many cards at once: Applying for multiple credit cards in a short period of time can lower your credit score.

Consider a secured credit card: If you're new to credit or have a low credit score, a secured credit card can be a good option. With a secured card, you'll need to put down a security deposit, which serves as collateral in case you don't make your payments.

Monitor your credit score: Regularly check your credit score and credit report to ensure that everything is accurate and to track your progress in building your credit.

So my 19 year old self made a dumb decision that has put myself in a financial problem early on in a way.

Pair that with a $411 insurance bill and you have a total cost of $903 a month for a car which is ridiculous.

Does anyone have any advice on how I could refinance to get that APR down and monthly payment down so I could actually have a savings? Due to how many times the dealership ran my credit I have to work on it again to get it back to what it may need to be, but I don't know what the requirements are to get approved for refinancing.

I was a happily employed person up until a few months back when I was smacked in the face with schizoaffective disorder.  Turns out those horror stories of getting a sudden serious mental disorder in your mid 20s are real, who knew?  The kicker is that my suddenly-unhinged behavior got me fired from my sweet gig with cause, so no unemployment for me.  Great stuff.  I'm doing great.

I'll be out of work for the next six or so months while I get this sorted out and I could use some advice.  I'm a single 26F and will be moving in with family and will be on Medicaid.  I think six months is a little lengthy for how much time I'll actually need, and I've historically been very employable.  So, *in six months I expect to be surviving and earning enough to float by.*  

I have a mortgage and just hired a property management company to rent out my house.  It is unlikely I will do anything beyond break even on rent, so no income there.  I like the house and plan on keeping it, god willing. Currently I don't have a renter but am hoping to find someone too.  It's new construction and if it does not rent in 3 months I will look into selling. 

**Here's my current picture:**

* $18k in Roth IRA (all contributions, got boned by the market in the last three years. no contributions in 2023)
* $18k vested in company owned 401k
* About $4k in checking
* No debt other than mortgage

I'm in a pretty good spot, all things considered.  

To stay afloat, *I need about $2k/month until I get a renter, which will drop it to $500/month.*  

**Here's the question:**

I will have to liquidate some amount of my retirement in the situation that I can't get a renter, or if there is an unexpected repair on the property.  Is it recommended that I begin by withdrawing the Roth IRA contributions, since they are penalty-free?  Should I leave my 401k sit with my previous employer or should I roll it into a different account?  Any other recommendations on how to keep myself afloat?

I knew her financial advisor was with Edward Jones and had casually mentioned using someone else several years ago. I just learned that she had bought whole life through him and that made me try again to get her to move to a fiduciary. She's in her early 70s, obviously has no dependents, and has a networth in the $2-3M range. Absolutely zero reason for her to buy whole life insurance.

She's said she's happy with Edward Jones because she's made money in the last several years. She's very hands off and happy to not pay attention to her investments and wants someone else to do it for her because it causes her anxiety.

Essentially, I work a very fruitful career. I make around $100k a year, and year two pay is roughly $230k. I’m just at the beginning of it all. 

I have a credit score currently of 720. I do not own a house, or much at all. I finance a car, and rent an apartment. That’s it. I made the decision to buy a family heirloom car, that the current owner agreed to sell for $20,000. Not having the immediate cash to buy I took a personal loan in the amount to not lose out on this deal. 

I’m not purchasing the item until June 1st (needs inspecting, transporting, etc). I have a credit line of roughly $25,000 over my 3 credit cards. One card in particular has a $4,000 balance on it. The others are maybe 5-10% usage. 

I make roughly $8k a month currently. Is it worth it to pay off that balance now, using the personal loan and the presumption I’ll save up the $4,000 for the car I’m buying before June, or just continue paying my cards off per paycheck?

Right now my family and I live in upstate NY and hate it, the weather, most of the people, taxes, nothing to do etc. We are both full time working parents, one of which makes 65k a year and the other 70k. Ultimately we’d like for one of us to get some type of civil service/government job for the benefits/pensions etc. We own a home and pay 1200/mo mortgage (property taxes escrowed in that).

We have debt totaling around 50k (this includes all of our credit cards, personal loans and one auto loan of 9k).

Our home is worth around 200k-210k (maybe more) and we owe 112k.

We filed ch. 13 back in 2018, and it’ll be discharged (finally!) in spring of next year. We are allowed to sell our house and keep the proceeds as we’d please. 

We’ve thrown the idea around of moving down south (FL in particular is our dream location) for some time now but we couldn’t figure out how to make it work until our kids would be in school, (finding and paying for daycare could be a hassle).

He left My mom(47) 2.7 million in untaxed cash. She makes about 90k a year. Has 200k in her 401k, also 350k left on the mortgage at a 1.9% interest rate (house is worth about 1 million today after purchasing for 600k 15 years ago), and zero credit card debt. I am 21 graduating college next semester with zero debt. My brother’s college fund is has been full since 2019 with 200k.

So my big questions are what the heck should my mom do? Is it possible to turn in 2.7 million into 10 million? Should we hire a financial advisor and dish them 1% a year? Or maybe Park it in a Bond for a year? Also my mom has no intention of retiring until she is 55.

2682,Seeking advice on investing for medical school: How to turn a $1000 investment into minimal debt?,"I'm currently a second semester freshman undergrad in university. I'm looking to invest some money to pay for medical school tuition and living expenses.

I'm super fortunate to have a scholarship that allows me to be able to complete my bachelor's degree with no debt. Also, I'm currently working as a student researcher that pays me about $600 a month ($2400 a month during winter and summer breaks), most of which I can invest into my future education. Additionally, I'm able to start with an \~$1000 initial investment. I'm very thankful for the opportunities presented to me to allow my financial health during these undergraduate years.

How should I invest this money to have a slight profit when paying for medical school \~3.5-4.5 years down the line? I've seen accounts specifically for higher education expenses like the 529, though I'm not exactly sure how to apply it in my situation (am a New York state resident attending school in another state).

How would this impact the potential financial aid I would get from medical schools? My family does not have the financial resources to support further education and I will be relying on financial aid and my investment to put me through (with hopefully minimal debt).

I currently have a brokerage account opened with Merrill Edge and would like to stick to it if possible.

2684,Mutual funds or tax sheltered retirements accounts?,"This may be an obvious question, but in the case of a tax-free windfall, it seems it would better to park that whole amount immediately into long term mutual funds rather than meting it out over a number of years into my (unmatched) 403b and 457b accounts.

Of course I’d lose the tax break from reduced income bracket, but it seems the extra time in the market and also paying the capital gains tax instead of income tax in distributions would make it more advantageous. Am I correct in thinking this?

2685,Pay off a 3.75% auto loan or keep $ in MMA for use in the next 12 months,"I'm curious about what the general consensus will be on this question. Should I pay off a 30K auto loan at 3.75% OR put the $ into my MMA with a 3.2% interest rate? Here are the reasons that I'm considering each option: 

Paying the loan off: 

1. The instant savings of 3.75% vs 3.2%. 

2. Getting the cash flow back monthly. 

3. the weight of owing on it goes away.

Putting the $ into my MMA: 

1. We have a list of home improvements that we want to do that are going to cost money and if I finance them it will likely be at a higher rate than 3.75%. 

Long term investing isn't an option for the use of this money because I know that we'll be spending money in the next year, but I'm already maxing out 401k, my home mortgage is at 2.75% so I won't be paying that off early and I don't have any other interest-bearing loans.

I'm faced with a dilemma, buying a home for my family or buying an asset. I'm relatively new to truly thinking about finance with the difference perspective I've recently acquired. I've worked hard for the past 4 years to build a savings that I can now invest but I've been extremely fearful.

I've been super happy about buying a home for my self and family but for some odd reason, I decided to read the book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" a couple days after receiving one of many pre-approval letters. I really don't know why I decided to finally take up the suggestion I've obtained from many.. but I did.

My outlook has changed considerably, even though it was already there.. it's just seen in a different light now, especially at this moment.

Emotions aside, I think for obvious reasons, obtaining asset is the best.. like property and stock portfolio. This will generate wealth that will allow more doors to open. It's like I feel to know the answer, but I feel like it's not common... so then is it really the right choice?

“The Golden 4” 
Civic
Accord
Camry
Corolla

I’m in my early 20s and I’m also building my credit. I plan to get an auto loan from my credit union after one year of having credit. What I’m worried about is that these dealerships wanting more out of me and giving me a 36 month or shorter term forcing the monthly payment to increase. I don’t want dealerships thinking, “OP is putting a big down payment to lower the monthly payment, let’s get OP into a shorter term contract to get more out of OP every month.” But that statement wouldn’t make sense because wouldn’t they get more out of me by having me in a longer contract (60+ months) to have me pay more in interest in the long run right? I want to finance for 48 months and get an open contract to have the option every month to pay more if I want. But $170 is max for me.

I was browsing around a few days ago and saw a car I likes: 2016 Honda Civic w/ 71k miles at $16k sticker price. Most of what I’ve seen from other dealerships is like that same 2016 Civic with 30k more miles and a couple thousand more.

2721,Should I buy the house nextdoor?,"The house nextdoor to mine recently went up for sale. It’s a 4 unit rental home and the current owner lives in one of the apartments. My assumption is he will be moving out but I haven’t talked to him yet. 2 of the other apartments are occupied and paying around $1,000/mo each, and the last apartment is empty and recently renovated (the other units are a bit dated, but I’ve seen the owner put in other work like new basement windows, etc). So it seems like I could collect approximately 4,000 in monthly rent. 

I still have my own mortgage (950/mo) and currently have about 25% of the cost of the sale house to put down (25% comfortably, I could go up to 1/3 of the cost). The estimated mortgage nextdoor is 1500/mo (the house is bigger than mine and asking price is twice the price of my house when I bought it in 2017). I already know people that would want to move in to the empty unit(s). Some of the main reasons I would want to buy is because I’d hate to see an absent landlord purchase the property, and I could help family secure better housing than they have right now. Long term, I would be receiving income from this home as well (I’m widowed so it’s nice to have a little extra income for financial security).

2733,What to do if I exceeded the income limits for Roth IRA Contributions in 2022?,"Hello,

My wife and I are in our mid 20’s. We made right at $300k combined in 2022. I contributed $6,000 at the beginning of 2022 towards my Roth IRA not knowing or expecting for us to exceed the individual and combined income limits for Roth contributions. 

I got a big promotion at work, and she is a realtor - and 2022 was a great year for her (she is 100% commission, and about half of my pay is performance related). That being said, I believe I need to withdraw my 2022 contribution to my Roth IRA to avoid paying penalties. 

I’ve read up on the back door roth, but I am not 100% clear how it works. It seems like you create a traditional IRA, and convert that into a roth. Do you do this every year? Meaning multiple roth accounts? Seems like it would be annoying to keep up with in the future. I’m just wondering what I should do about my 2022 contribution, and for the years moving forward. I do have a 401k - planning to max out each year moving forward. I believe I contributed 18k in 2022.

Should I get a financial advisor? We do pretty well. No debt except our home. Good savings, etc. just trying to make sure we make the right moves today so we can retire comfortable in the future.

I will have significantly less income for the next few years due to entering a doctorate program that will not allow me to work full time (he's done with school- we prioritized his education).   


Knowing this, how should we file taxes this year? Will this have an effect on  the FAFSA regardless? Any advice concerning filing taxes and FAFSA in a way that reflects my financial situation this year rather than in the past?"

I have a brokerage account with maybe $3.3K in Vanguard’s VGSTX, an actively managed fund. My dad invested my money in high school for me in this fund. Rate of return for past 10 years (about when I started investing in it) 9.09% with an expense ratio of .31%.

I’ve never really had to pay much taxes until this year on it, and it ended up having $181.52 in capital gain distributions. Total $242 dividends &amp; distributions. 

Do I sell out of this or just keep it in there long term? I know last year was a bad year and maybe that’s why I owed more taxes on it for the first time. But the expense ratio is also pretty high. I’m not sure if it’s worse to sell all my holdings in it and incur a large taxable event or just keep it in there and invest in other things. 

I also have $2k just sitting in cash in there. I’m not sure what to invest it in. 

Would love any advice! Should I look into I-bonds? Or should I just buy more Index ETFs, like VUG, VOE, VBR, VWO and VEA like I have in other tax-advantaged accounts.

2805,Finance for out of state move with elderly mother,"Hi All,

I’m planning on relocating this year from the east coast to Nashville. I’m 30 and she’s retiring next month. We currently live together in a house that’s paid off. She’s a single mom and I’m an only child so we’d like to be close with her getting older. 

I’d like to move to Nashville by end of this year. She would stay behind for 6 months to a year but would eventually join. I’d like to own my own home/condo but anything I like is $400-475k. 

I suggested she buys her home in Nashville with equity on the house she has now. I could live in that house and pay half her mortgage until she sells the house we currently live in. The houses she likes in Nashville area are $100-150k more than what she would sell our current home for. I could stay in the Nashville house for a year or two. 

I have some savings and stock for a down payment of my own but I’d like to save more and knock out some minimal student loan debt. However, I’d like to begin my life in a new area sooner than later. I don’t want to move and change cities when I’m 35 or 40. Id like for the move to take place this year.

2831,Does it make sense to upgrade to an electric car?,"I have some friends and colleagues who recently got electric cars, and it got me wondering if I should make an upgrade too, and I'm trying to see if it financially makes sense and would be worth it because it looks like monthly loan payments would cost less than my car payments + gas. So far I am looking at the Chevy Bolt EV or EUV and Hyundai Ioniq 5 (I love how Polestar 2 looks but it'd be too expensive, same for Teslas too). I'm listing down the info below to make it straightforward and easier to read:

About me:

* 21 years old
* 100k salary + upcoming bonus, my monthly take-home pay is around $5500 after taxes/benefits/401k
* I currently live with my parents, so my expenses are food, gas, chipping in for groceries/house expenses, personal spending, flight training (hopefully ending soon; the exam is coming up)

My current car and commute/driving info:

* 2019 Camry at ~55k miles
   * $290 monthly payments (until May 2027, it was leased and we financed it)
   * Remaining debt: $14790, payoff quote as of today: $13500, current trade-in value: ~$16000
   * Fuel expenses: $130/mo (the tank usually fills for $45 and I usually buy gas two or three times per month)
   * Upcoming expenses: oil change in 3 months, front tire replacement sometime later this year, general inspection/maintenance (used to be free when it was leased)
* Monthly driving info:
   * Commute: ~720 miles (~45 miles away, two days per week)
   * Taking my sister to tutoring, school/extracurricular activities: ~200 miles
   * Local driving (driving for flight training, Target/Shoprite/mall, visiting friends, etc.): ~200 miles
   * Random local road trip (usually once a month): ~100 miles

My calculations:

* Monthly car expenses: $420 + oil change and other maintenance
* ""Profit"" from paying off and selling the car: $2500, so not underwater/upside down on the loan
* Chevy Bolt EUV ($32k at local dealers) with trade in, 60-month loan: $400/month

So if my calculations are correct, my monthly payments for an EV car would be less than what I’m paying and EVs don’t have other expenses such as oil change, engine maintenance, etc. There are charging stations at my office’s parking deck, many nearby, and even the possibility of charging at home.

2837,Question about deduction ineligible contributions to a traditional IRA,"My understanding is if I make a contribution to my traditional IRA, and I'm not eligible for a deduction, I will still have to pay taxes on not just the gains (expected) but also the contribution amount upon withdrawal. 

I understand that the advantage of doing this is that I don't have to pay tax in the realized investment income during the time it's in the IRA, but is that it?

Because if I did this I'd be paying taxes on the 6k contribution amount twice right? It's post-tax money already and I'm ineligible for deduction, and it's taxed again after IRA withdrawal.

2847,Did my financial advisor have any liability to me based on what they did? more in post:,"Hi,
Long story short:

-2 years ago I was financially illiterate 
-I found a financial advisor who sold me a life insurance policy so that I could opt out of WA's long term care tax.
-he implied the tax would be a lot, but in reality it's 30 a month
-he implied that the life insurance account would pay out a huge multiple later in life, but recently it was just 5% year over year
-this policy costs me 150 a month

Here's the rub- he sold me this policy in early 2019. You could not opt out of state coverage until 2020.

He never ever, even once reminded me to opt out of the state program, as he told me he would.
( he failed to add me to his info email and I got no notifications)

So basically, I've spent 3200 over the last two years to leverage opting out of mandatory state long term care tax, but I didn't opt out, so now it's just a life insurance policy.


I feel majorly ripped off, am I being ridiculous?

My age is 37 and I make ~200k, but base is 155k. 

I joined my current employer in 2020 so all of these funds are down from the last year. -8% on FGKFX, -22% on DBMYX, and -22% on HNACX.

FXAIX ER =.015%
DBMYX = .63%
HNACX = .63%

I contribute the max 20k to my retirement each year and my employer contributes 15k, so 35k total.

VTTSX ER (2060 retirement fund) = .08%

It seems like HNACX and DBMYX  are not rated as well by morningstar but Im not sure if I should stick with them or abandon them now. Their longterm returns seem to be decent, although the last night 5 years are not good for HNACX.

I set up a Fidelity account on Friday and set up the transfer on Empower’s site under the Withdrawal &gt; Transfer &gt; Wire to Fidelity and put my Rollover account number. 

Today I received a letter in my Empower account that it transferred but I don’t see it in my Fidelity? 

Did I do something wrong? 
Should I contract Empower customer service to confirm if it got in the right account?
How long would it take take to appear in my Fidelity account?

2875,HELP: I NEED to make my monies grow!!,"I have money chilling in my savings not making me much . I've been reading about the best places to put money to let it rest and acquire some interest or whatever...
So far I've read about Roth IRA vs traditional IRA. I most def don't mind putting In some money every pay check. I have a feeling putting in taxes money would be best for me but not hundred percent sure... also how much money does the acct make if you max it out? And when do you have to max it out by? 

Stocks sound fun but I have no experience in the jargon so I'm always getting lost on the next best place to put money. Any help or good readers for dummies are welcomed and appreciated.

I've read about hysa.. again not too sure how profitable they are. Is a Roth IRA better than an hysa? Cons and pros?

2897,Pay off mortgage now or invest this year (2023),"Without giving out too many details, I would love to hear any of your input whether I should pay off my mortgage right now, or invest the money I have. From what I’ve learned, the market might be a bit shaky this year, especially with the looming prospect the U.S. could default if the debt ceiling is not increased, therefore impacting the stock market. So investing now would potentially result in a loss. 

My current mortgage remaining is $50k with an interest rate of 4.5%; monthly payment of $520 excluding HOA. I have been saving up this past year to reach my goal of having $70k total in savings, idea being $50k to pay off mortgage and $20k remaining for a 6 month buffer in case I lost my job.

My thought process is if the market looks a bit rough ahead, pay the mortgage off now guaranteeing a 4.5% ROI, have an extra $520 a month I can then pump a portion into a 401k (decent match by employer) as well as additional investments within the market, and also have some additional savings to travel (something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time).

2921,What are the benefits of using a 401k or 403b vs taxable retirement account?,"This is a question related to qualified retirement plans like 401k's or 403b's. What exactly is the benefit of tax deferral? Is it just that you hope to be in a lower tax bracket later once you retire, and the savings is based on the difference between your tax bracket now and your tax bracket later?

I see this argument in online articles all the time that by deferring taxes, you have a larger pot of money to compound. I'm confused by this because if your tax bracket is the same now vs later, you still end up with the exact same amount of money whether you pay taxes now or later, right? On top of this is the fact that the gains in retirement accounts are all taxed as income vs as capital gains, so could you actually end up paying MORE in tax on your retirement assets than if you had just put them in a regular taxable account?

Relatedly, what would ever be the point of using a Roth retirement account?

Not sure if it is needed. Planning to open taxable account VTI 60%, VXUS 40% planning to use this to pay for our house after 10 to 20 years or perhaps supplement our goal to retire early.

2. Do you think we can retire in our 50's? I'm planning to open a taxable account to supplement our early retirement. How much do i need in order to do that? Im planning to leave my 401k at 15% in order for me to invest in taxable account. I know tax advantaged accounts are better because it greatly reduce your tax in the future.

BB3. Is it ok to open taxable account then let it grow and use it to pay for our house? I have chronic illness so i just want to make sure my wife and my daughter will have a paid for house if ever things goes south for me. Also our health insurance especially for me, how are we going to have health insurance if we plan to retire early? 

4. What is our current Tax Income Bracket? Do we also need to file taxes in our Retirement accounts? For Taxable account do we also need to file tax or if we just sell?  Im sorry, i know I sucked at math.

*Bought a house 30years to pay amounting $570k at 2.75% interest rate. $489k remaining. Redfin estimation is at $800k to $900k now, we bought this 2020 during pandemic. Amazing new neighborhood, has a lot of school nearby, groceries etc.

*My 401k that has $10k (contributing 15%) VEXAX 20%, VFIAX 80%. Employer using EMPOWER. This is only their only fund that has lowest ER. Employer Match 5%.

*My ROTH IRA has $6k, will add $6k for 2023. FSKAX 60%; FTIHX 40% (ROTH IRA IS IN FIDELITY) 

*Started HSA this year, will decide where to invest Til I reach to allowable amount first ($1.9k) (THIS IS IN OPTUM BANK) 


*Wife has $113k in her 401k, TDF (RFKTX 2055, Expense ratio 0.38%) Currently contributing at 20%; employer Match 7%. employer uses Fidelity.

*Wife ROTH IRA has $12k, will add $6k for 2023. (FSKAX 60%, FTIHX 40%) this is in FIDELITY

*Wife employer dont offer HSA.

* 529 plan NY savings college. We have $5k ready to invest for our daughter and will continue to put $200 a month.

* Emergency fund $25k.

* 2 Cars paid for.

*** Our POST TAX INCOMe monthly $11,000. If there's OT $12,000. Our income could go up further more, since RN are always in demand and US has acute shortage of RN.  

***Planning to open taxable account and put 60% VTI , 40% VXUS. 

**Planning to retire Early here in the US. (WA state)

**** We have no debt, we always pay our only 1 credit card (use to pay for our day to day expenses), and mortgage at the end of the month.

*Mortgage-$2750
*Utilities $100 - $200 ( lower during summer )
*Gas for 2 cars - $150 to $200 for 2 cars monthly
*Phone and internet $150
*Car insurance $188 (we have 2 cars, paid for)
*Food,groceries - $400 to 800 a month (Varies because of higher prices nowadays) inflation.
*For leisure - $100 to $200
*Family support in home country, monthly - $300 to $500
*Child support in home country - $150 monthly. Plus tuitions fees quarterly $200 - $300.

We will always max our ROTH IRA as well as my wife 401k. Im planning to only do 15% for my 401k because im thinking of investing in taxable account for paying off the house or supplement our early retirement.

My wife made $113k gross; I made $92k gross. We get 2x increase annually but hers is higher than me because she works in the hospital. Both of us can do a lot of OT if our schedule allows us but we have a kid at home. We dont send her to daycare, we just alternate our schedule to be able to take care of our daughter.

QUESTIONS: 
1. Are the Allocation of our Portfolio good enough until we retire?we'll switch slowly to bonds til we get closer to retirement. I dont exacly know when, how to rebalance our portfolio in the future. Not sure if it is needed. Planning to open taxable account VTI 60%, VXUS 40% planning to use this to pay for our house after 10 to 20 years or perhaps supplement our goal to retire early.

2. Do you think we can retire in our 50's? I'm planning to open a taxable account to supplement our early retirement. How much do i need in order to do that? Im planning to leave my 401k at 15% in order for me to invest in taxable account. I know tax advantaged accounts are better because it greatly reduce your tax in the future.

BB3. Is it ok to open taxable account then let it grow and use it to pay for our house? I have chronic illness so i just want to make sure my wife and my daughter will have a paid for house if ever things goes south for me. Also our health insurance especially for me, how are we going to have health insurance if we plan to retire early? 

4. What is our current Tax Income Bracket? Do we also need to file taxes in our Retirement accounts? For Taxable account do we also need to file tax or if we just sell?  Im sorry, i know I sucked at math.

2943,"Grand plan written out, advice on missing items?","grand plan, thoughts please

So. I've posted a few times over the last few months here and personal finance and first time home buyer. I think I finally have my grand plan + direction for about 24-48 straight months if nothing changes for my wife and I, or at least nothing drastic. 
1. Pay off taxes around 4k in March. 
2. Pay off wife's car loan of 4500 in May
3. Summer/vacation planning for stuff ~around 2k (3 bachelor parties + weddings for three best friends between May-October)
4. ~14 months from now pay off consolidation loan #1 ~9k 
5. ~28 months from now Pay off consolidation loan #2 ~21k
6. Grow emergency savings from ~2 months to 6 months. 
7. Save for first time home buyers down payment. Looking to save in two parts. 10k for closing costs/extras and about 25k-35k for a down payment for a 220-250k house. (Currently around 16k saved for both these things (majority in a CD) for both e-savings and down-payment stuff. 

I have several differented allocated accounts to cover bases, investing, and overall saving that I will continue but pause the bigger amounts. Basically think Dave Ramsey 'ish because I will always continue to invest while paying off stuff. Next thing to tackle after buying a house will be both mine and my wife's student loans. But I'm happy to say I do not have any CC debt after consolidation, no car payment, no medical bills, and rent is cheap so we are able to accelerate/avalanche the savings/debt pay off. I've mapped out majority of the bills/budget so I think once I pay off her car loan then she will be able to pay off student loans quicker or pay for her schooling that she's in right now.

2974,How to use a lump sum of cash to get out of debt - two options,"Looking for advice on how to utilize a lump sum of cash to get into a better financial position.

The background: My husband and I are starting on our debt free journey and need your help to settle a debate on what to do with some money we will get from the sale of a pop up camper that we own outright. We have lived frivolously (carelessly) for years, and even though we make enough money to live comfortably and debt-free, we find ourselves with 40k in high interest credit card debt. A lot of this is from a recent home renovation which went way over budget, so we have added equity to our house (second bathroom). Anyway, we've started using YNAB (You Need a Budget) and are hoping to crush the credit card debt and start saving for our family's future. We've agreed to the avalanche method and have already had success tightening our budget and having money each month to put toward our highest interest card.

THE DEBATE: There are two things at play here - a pop up camper that is paid in full and an auto loan on a vehicle we can't afford. We have agreed to sell our pop up camper which we don't use as much as we thought we would, to help us get into a better financial position. What should we do with the proceeds of this sale?

The camper: Agreed to part with this asset, it should sell for appx $12,500

The vehicle: We owe $32,000 and it's currently worth less than that, maybe $28,000 (ouch). We've agreed that we should get out of this car and into something with better mileage and less cost to own. We agree we would be comfortable with a vehicle we could get for about $10,000 (wish we realized this a year ago when we financed the luxury car).

SHOULD WE:

Use the funds from the camper sale to pay down our highest interest credit card (7k at 30% and 5k at 27%). Then, trade in our vehicle at a dealership and get into a lower car payment each month. PRO: We've paid off our highest interest card and half of our second highest interest card - a huge win for Cc debt payoff journey. CON: We are paying dealer fees and not getting as much for our car as we could on a private sale. Also, we'll still have a car payment.

Use the funds from the camper sale to buy a car from a private seller. Sell our car and pay out of pocket the difference we owe on the loan to value. PRO: We don't have a car payment, we make Dave Ramsey fans very happy. We own this asset outright and we've paid no dealer fees and gotten more for our current vehicle selling private party. CON: We haven't put a huge chunk toward our highest interest debt and the 40k is still looming.

My husband and I are having a healthy debate and would love your expert input! Thanks in advance :)",FinancialPlanning,"How to use a lump sum of cash to get out of debt - two options Looking for advice on how to utilize a lump sum of cash to get into a better financial position.

The background: My husband and I are starting on our debt free journey and need your help to settle a debate on what to do with some money we will get from the sale of a pop up camper that we own outright. We have lived frivolously (carelessly) for years, and even though we make enough money to live comfortably and debt-free, we find ourselves with 40k in high interest credit card debt. A lot of this is from a recent home renovation which went way over budget, so we have added equity to our house (second bathroom). Anyway, we've started using YNAB (You Need a Budget) and are hoping to crush the credit card debt and start saving for our family's future. We've agreed to the avalanche method and have already had success tightening our budget and having money each month to put toward our highest interest card.

THE DEBATE: There are two things at play here - a pop up camper that is paid in full and an auto loan on a vehicle we can't afford. We have agreed to sell our pop up camper which we don't use as much as we thought we would, to help us get into a better financial position. What should we do with the proceeds of this sale?

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts:**

* Housing (including mortgage/HOA/utilities) \~1550/month. I paid my mortgage until May 2023. Any purpose in paying it earlier to my principal? My interest rate is 3 percent FWIW.
* Cell phone: 75/month (cheapest I could find for 3 lines)
* Credit cards: I can't give a rough estimate but, this is used for groceries, entertainment, gas, etc. I owe like $1000 right now on it.
* Cant think of anything else other than the usual property tax, insurance that would be due at a certain time,etc....

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets/Savings:**

* Discover high yield savings (3.3 percent interest): 69K saved

&amp;#x200B;

* Empower 401K (this is from my previous full-time job that I am now per diem with): \~20K. **I am not sure if I should transfer this? is it better to keep it here or another company?**

&amp;#x200B;

* Fidelity Roth IRA: \~1500k in the account. **I honestly have no idea what truly I'm doing with this account other than going by the general consensus here to ""buy"" FZROX, FZILZ, FXNAX,etc. I just been putting 50-100 in each portfolio, if I remember. I would like to improve in this area. I contributed $1076 in 2022 and $250 as of this year. So  not sure where the rest came from, unless thats in the money market.**

&amp;#x200B;

* (NEW) Charles Schwab 401K.  Through my new job. I am contributing 7 percent of my paycheck . **The rep told me my employer will match 125 percent and up to 6 percent. Not sure what this means. Is this good? The rep told me she was jealous. Should I contribute more?** P.S., I got soo lucky because they made a new policy where employees won't be matched until a year of employment. This was for  employees hired 1/1/23. I got hired 12/19/22.

 

* (NEW) HSA account. This was recently made through my new employer. I believe I am aiming to contribute a high amount. - like 2800? **Should I increase this?** 

&amp;#x200B;

* Credit Card miles/points/CB: ok not sure if this counts lol. But I have about $4k worth of points/miles/CB. Due to noninvestment purposes, I'll put this aside.

**My income:**

* I'm a social worker, since getting my MSW 3 years ago. I'm not sure if my salary will go up but I am working three jobs now, so technically in a sense, it has gone up
* Full time job: \~61K/ year
* Per diem gig remote: i work an average of 15 hours per week, 34/hr. I think I made the mistake of switching to 1099. Not sure if I should talk to my boss again and go back to W2. But I dont think I can.
* Per diem hospital: unsure of the hours as of this time, but hopefully i will work one weekend day every other weekend. 30/hr. but who knows, maybe ill work more/ less. I am welcome to pick up more as needed

**How I consolidate/plan:**

I just pay the bills by ""prioritization"" otherwise, i just send the remaining of my paycheck to my Discover account. I act like I'm living below my means.

2985,Is Whole Life Insurance a good idea?,"Hello and thank you for your advice! 

My financial advisor has suggested that purchasing whole life insurance would be a financially good idea for my husband and I. I have always thought that it would be better to invest our money then purchase whole life insurance. 

Here are our financial details: 

We are both 46. 

I am a teacher and have a pension in which I will get 70% of my highest income when I retire. I will not get social security. 

We have $375,000 in retirement savings. My husband will get social security and we will draw from our retirement savings once we retire. We own our home and will pay it off in 20 years. 

These were the points she made when she was trying to convince us that whole life insurance would be a good idea: 

1) She suggesting getting insurance that would provide a $500,000 death benefit for our son. 

2) She said you can draw money out of your whole life insurance for emergencies, and then pay it back, without affecting the final death benefit. 

3) She explained that if you invest with the purpose of leaving an inheritance, and then need to draw on the investments for an emergency, it can significantly affect the final balance of the investments even if you pay it back. For instance if you draw on your investments, and then the market does poorly, there can be dramatic negative repercussions in your final balance. 

I listen to a lot of financial podcasts, and I have never heard the podcasters say that whole life insurance was the best way to create an inheritance for your children or others. Aren't the insurance companies just making money at your expense with whole life insurance? I worry that she is suggesting whole life insurance because she'll get a commission with the sale.

2996,Faced with major financial decision at 26 yo - build a house or go live life?,"I live on an island in Greece and, at 26 yo, I did not expect to still be living with my parents. I stayed here because of the pandemic and my life ended up being quite comfortable, although a little bit dull.

For the past three or so years, I have been lucky enough to escape the standard career path of most of my peers, who are earning maybe 700-1000 euros per month. I work remotely for a US company, and even though the pay is low for them it is huge for Greek standards, and even though I am tired of the job I have saved up around 60k, given that my living expenses are almost nonexistent. 

Now the thing is. My family has always been relatively poor. My mum’s a teacher and my dad is a construction worker. My dad has always built villas for other people who had the capital to benefit from tourism, which is the #1 “industry” here.

I own a piece of land in one of the dreamiest places for villas, and that plot is actually surrounded by luxurious homes with pools. My dad is relatively old, he will be 60 soon, and we had the idea of starting to build a villa ourselves to have a stable source of income. My dad can’t keep doing this physically demanding job for too many years to come, and retirement will be extremely minimal, given the state of my country. 

The “market price” for the villa I have in mind would be over 150k. This would be less for us, considering my dad’s been in the industry and can build a lot of the things himself and knows people.

 

The issue is that this project really IS doable, but at what cost? 

I would have to spend all of my savings and then either get a loan, or delay completion. 

I don't want to commit to living with my parents for the next two or three years just to finish this project, I already feel that I have overstayed my welcome at this place. I always dreamed of living abroad. I have a very fuzzy idea of what I want my life to look like in the future, but figuring that out probably requires travel and money. I stayed here because of the pandemic and I did not imagine to still be here after all this time. I don't feel a particular rush to move, but I am afraid of getting stuck here for the long-term. 

It is comfortable to earn what I earn as a writer, but I feel I would also like to explore other career paths. Essentially I am very unsure about what to do with my life right now.  it would not make sense to get up and leave while still committing to spending thousands on a big project like that at the same time, right?

Ideally, I would get started on this project later. But my dad may not be able to help out with this 5 years down the line. I feel very pressured. Would I be passing up on a huge opportunity if I don’t get this started? Or will I find myself shackled by financial obligations and unable to change my life if things go south?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to commit to living with my parents for the next two or three years just to finish this project, I already feel that I have overstayed my welcome at this place. I always dreamed of living abroad. I have a very fuzzy idea of what I want my life to look like in the future, but figuring that out probably requires travel and money. I stayed here because of the pandemic and I did not imagine to still be here after all this time. I don't feel a particular rush to move, but I am afraid of getting stuck here for the long-term. 

It is comfortable to earn what I earn as a writer, but I feel I would also like to explore other career paths. Essentially I am very unsure about what to do with my life right now.  it would not make sense to get up and leave while still committing to spending thousands on a big project like that at the same time, right?

Ideally, I would get started on this project later. But my dad may not be able to help out with this 5 years down the line. I feel very pressured. Would I be passing up on a huge opportunity if I don’t get this started? Or will I find myself shackled by financial obligations and unable to change my life if things go south?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I am a 26yo still living in my hometown and wanting to go out and life life at some point, but what if I should dump all my savings to build a villa to secure some level of financial independence for my family for the years to come?"

3010,Smartest thing to do with $250K at age 73,"Hello,

This is on behalf of my dad. He’s not the most financially literate person. He worked a government job for 20+ years and has a pension and social security. His take home pay is something around $3K a month I think. He has an $1100 mortgage and owes probably close to $250K. My mom passed away a couple years ago and she had a life insurance policy and so he got $250K. I asked him today where he has the money because it came up in conversation and he said in a Chase savings account lol. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Literally $25 per year in interest. I immediately told him to open up a HYSA and explained to him that he could be making an extra $600+ per month with his money. He said he would “check it out”, which basically means he doesn’t trust it, I’m assuming. He’s super paranoid about everything.

I know damn well I’d never get this man to invest into any index fund or anything with this money. He thinks all investing is gambling and I’m not even going to try. Any advice on this? I’d like to have that money growing in the safest way possible so that if he has health problems later on he can pull from that.

3015,Should I move back in with Parents to achieve FIRE?,"Hi everyone, myself and my wife are fairly young in our late 20s and have a great relationship with my parents. We have a 270k HHI and around 350k in cash as well as own our primary residence home which we have 15% equity and a price of 450k at a 3% 30 yr rate. My parents live alone in a larger 4000+ sqft home with 6 beds 5 baths on the best lot of a golf course backyard- I’ll most likely be inheriting this home in the future as my own primary residence - probably valued at around 1mil which I helped cosign with them and bought at 700k list at a 2.75% 30 yr rate. They have enough cash to pay off the home outright, but why bother when rates are so low. 

Okay so enough of the back story, basically I calculated with our current housing expenses of around 3k+ a month we will need around 1.5mil to fire which could take us 6-7 years if we save 100k a year with 7% annual growth. If I move back in with my parents, we’ll basically have the one side of the home to ourselves and I am planning to break down two rooms and renovate into a master suite. At the end of the day, our cost of living will go down substantially, which will allow us to FIRE years earlier as well as always having less financial stress because we know we have good careers and my parents have good financial backing as well. My wife and my goal once we retire is to travel the world as much as we can while working two less demanding remote jobs that we are overqualified for so the work can be done quick.

Would you move back in with your parents knowing your relationship with them is very respectful &amp; healthy and that it will allow you to retire much earlier?

3047,How much of my annual bonus should go to my 401(k)?,"Every spring, my company gives me a cash bonus of $25-30k USD. In the past few years, we haven’t had the option to change 401(k) contributions specifically for the bonus amount, so my standard contribution of 15% was taken off the top of my bonus and put straight into my 401(k). Then there was the income tax withholding on what was left, leaving me with “only” 60% of my cash bonus going as actual cash into my bank account. The tradeoff has been that my 401(k) is maxed out around September, leaving me with slightly higher paychecks the last few months of the year. 

This year, we have the option to set a different 401(k) contribution % to be applied to the bonus only - so I could change this to 0% and be left with my full bonus as cash after taxes. 

Question is, what should I do?

I don’t necessarily need the extra cash upfront. The potential bigger paychecks at the end of the year don’t really make a difference to me either. My spouse thinks I should leave the bonus deferral at 15% so that more cash gets invested sooner for more time to grow, etc. However I think it might be better to take the bonus as all cash now (after withholding), leaving my normal 401(k) contributions the same all year long for better dollar cost averaging.

3056,How do homeowners keep up with repairs on their home and paying their mortgage?,"26\[M\], $78k/yr, $1,888/monthly FHA at 2.65% 30/yr fixed.

Disclaimer, I came from being a homeless child to living in a shelter with my mom and then living in public housing. My mom sacrificed a lot to get here and these past couple years have been very hard on all of us. My mother played a huge gamble and put her life savings and emergency funds into buying a fixer upper in 2020. We took out loans, fixed it up and in 2022 we made a profit of $100k. This was the most we've ever had. 

It has been precisely one year since we bought our current house. It was bought as-is, the home was built on a slope so I had to fix up the basement flooding. It costed approx. $13k for our french drain and sump pump. We paid a couple lump-sum in the beginning and currently owe $7k. The 0% interest rate ends in August so I recently changed the monthly premium to $500/month and will pay a lump sum to finish off when the 0% offer is over. 

We then needed to mitigate the humidity issues so we installed HVAC downstairs. I opted for mini-split air conditioners for a total cost of $17k. I pay approx. $330/month at 0% which is for a total of 60 months. (upstairs has hvac but it was installed incorrectly. previous owner was a DIY guy and did a furnace and heat pump mismatch but I will correct it after my current hvac loan is paid off) 

I then paid $13k to finish the basement in cash so now I have $46k in my checking acct. Overall the house is finished. There still remains to be exterior repairs to be made such as the front porch concrete to be the correct grade and slope, fixing the driveway, perimeter edge garden bed to help with drainage and garage concrete is rekt so that needs to be finished, one of the last things I'd like to do is solar panels to get our electric bill to $0. 

Based on previous estimates and quotes. Driveway is like $2-6k depending on material. Sideyard garden bed for drainage is $2k. I don't know how much concrete for the porch would cost but I imagine roughly $5k and the garage renovation would be like $10k if I were to get concrete, insulation, and drywall. I would run out of money so I've decided to come to a halt and re-evaluate my finances. 

Note: I am not going to sell and downsize. I've been fortunate to land a 2.65% interest rate. Literally everyone has told me to not sell because that interest rate is rare in this economy. I just want advice how homeowners manage their finances and don't go broke.

Both have company matching 401ks and pensions. At different points within the next 2.5 years, most of our larger loans (sans mortgage) will be fully paid off, providing a bunch of extra free cash flow for us (approx $2500/month). While we make a good salary, we never seem to feel all that great about our savings situation due to some of these loans. Neither of us got much, if any, assistance from our parents and frankly we just didn’t do a good enough job saving in our late 20s.

Here are three things we are trying to plan for:

1. College expenses for both kids. Plan to open 529 and contribute 250 per kid per month in to it. With 6% return, should amount to about $100k per child once they’re ready for college. 

2. We’d like have the ability to help both kids with one, some or all of the following: wedding expenses (Hindu wedding), a car, down payment on house. This is where I struggle. Do I setup individual savings accounts in their name and contribute towards it each month, earning practically nothing on the money? Do I create an investment account under parents names and draw from it when needed? If so, what type to avoid the most taxes/penalties? Do I forego a savings account and contribute more to 529 knowing I can convert some to Roth IRA, or I believe I can withdraw my 529 contributions without penalty? 

3. Estate/money to pass down when we are no longer alive. We have term life insurance policies through work, but nothing outside of that. Do we start to look in to this? We aren’t maxing out our 401k contributions, mostly because we are hindered by the loans that will all be gone in next 2.5 years.

3067,Advice for my plan of getting out of debt,"Hello, 

I will just get straight to it over the last year I have managed to accrue over 18k in debt on my credit cards. I have over 10k on one card a little over 8k on another and around 500 on the last card. I came up with a plan myself but would like to get some second opinions. Before I get to the plan I’ll fill you guys in a little on my income. I have two jobs and being in 1,350 between the both of them every two weeks. I have budgeted out between 500-600 for payments on my cards every month. (Depending on the paychecks) so I’ll just say 500 to keep it simple. Two of my credit cards have 0 interest until July and the other (8k) card has 19% interest. 

My Plan:
So my plan was to take a loan out of my 401k of 14,500. So I could pay off the bulk of my debt without interest, and pay off about half of my card with the 19% interest. In doing this if I kept my budget of 500 I was gonna keep paying on my cards anyway I would pay off my last card in bout a year. Then I could actually start putting that 500 into savings to put back into my 401k immediately. I would also still be good on my finances as well after doing this. I know I would be a couple years behind on my 401 but I can make up for that in the future by investing more into it as well. 

As a last note I also may be able to get a 0 interest loan through my job for a high amount possible 10 and they would take out the payments directly from my paycheck as well however they would probably be higher. That is still an unknown factor at the moment though. I was just wondering if I could get some second opinions on my plan. 

I thank you all for taking a minute to read and hopefully I can navigate through the murky waters I got myself into.

I bought 10 acres of walkable and build able land in WV in 21 with the hopes of moving out there sometime this year. Things have changed a bit and my employment seems to not care about my request to transfer work locations despite having a location close to the land. That being said the land has been sitting there and I want to do with my money. I payed it off almost a year ago and if I was to switch locations up there I would want a bigger parcel anyway. With all that said the son in law of the original owners inherited the other half of my parcel and has expressed interest in purchasing my portion and already moved in to his parcel. On top of this love 8 hours round trip from my parcel and have started thinking that I can sell it for like 20-30% profit (I bought it for 75k) and put it into my current mortgage and pay it off quickly or put it into a duplex and turn it into a rental. I spoke with the realtor who helped me purchase the land and he was encouraging me to invest into the property and turn it into an Airbnb / VRBO etc but I don't really have any connections there and don't have much more time.

3090,"Question about real estate in a living trust, marriage, and capital gains.","I have a property in a high cost-of-living area.  I live in it and also rent out part of it.  The rental income covers most of my costs for the property.

Since it is my personal residence, I deduct about half of the mortgage interest on my 1040, whereas the other half is a Schedule E expense against the rental income.  I also get a homeowner exemption on property taxes.

I am considering putting the property in a trust for estate planning.  I believe an LLC is out of the question because of the homeowner tax breaks, is that correct?

Anyway, suppose this property is in my own living trust and I get married in a few years.  I've heard that revocable trusts are pass-through for taxation purposes.  If I were to sell the property and was married filing jointly, would I get a capital gains exclusion of 250k (individual), 500k (MFJ), or something more complicated due to the partial use as a rental property?

Is there any other entity structure or option that I am overlooking?

I understand the guaranteed rate of return you receive when paying off vs the variable return you would get when investing. Also the rule that whatever I decide, I can't use it for another purpose. This money whether invested or payed down is for the loan at the end of modified loan term. I just want a sanity check here.

Private Loan: $76k @ 3.46%

My plan: Invest whatever money I planned to throw at the loan into a brokerage fidelity index fund. Whatever money I invest monthly, I can put into my loan amortization table to resemble what my loan would look like at the end...That is - Once the loan is zero (based on had I payed down the debt), I cross reference my brokerage to see where I'm at. 

Specifically, my brokerage at a whole should equal (remaining loan balance + $ interest saved had I payed off the loan taken from amortization table - capital gains). 

As a side note, I believe the risk here is relatively small. Even if I come out below from what I would have received just paying it off, I still will have a significant amount of money to throw at the loan barring a complete stock market meltdown. added bonus of some sort of liquidity throughout the 8 or so years I'm projecting to pay this off.",FinancialPlanning,"Yet another invest vs payoff Student Loan post Okay so here's the gist.

3113,Work remotely but want my dream car?,"I work remotely so this would be 100% a luxury.

I make $110/year. I drive an 8-year-old car that works fine with no major issues i just need to buy 4 new tires which is where my decision is coming from. Why buy them if i get a new car?

I invest, I save etc.

The car I want is expensive esp for someone that works from home. Its a 63k car. Its been my dream car for many years.

I have zero debt right now because all i ever do is save, not spend, and invest and never spend money on myself.

I have a few vacations coming up and although i can financially swing this all, the frugalness inside me is struggling with this impractical decision to get the car I want.

I planned on getting a new car (my dream car) once this car kicks it. But i drive a toyota and its just in perfect condition and seems like it will never die (i know thats a good thing) but just more that i can't seem to justify the expense when i have a great situation.

Its very freeing to be debt-free and ive made sacrifices including never going out with friends or vacationing until i was 30. Now i just feel like i want something silly just because.

A fancy car wont really get me from one place to another any different than my current car.

Ive thought about how my trade in value will be worth more now than later, and with the trade in it means less in sales tax for this car.

Im not sure if there will ever be the perfect time to get a new car. Its a bad time, higher interest rates, low inventory, but who is to say it wont stay this way? I doubt that parts will get cheaper. I could go for a cheaper new car, sure. But when do you just pull the trigger on the car you want vs the one thats financially responsible?",FinancialPlanning,"Work remotely but want my dream car?

I’m 25 and just started my first post grad job and I’m making $120k a year base with potentially a little more if I pick up hours. I have plenty of federal students loans and one private loan (~$8k) that I’m thinking about just paying all off right now because of the higher interest rate.

I understand the difference between pre tax and post tax money, but I’m not sure how I should split it if at all. 

I just opened up a Roth IRA through Fidelity and put in the 2022 max of $6k and will max 2023 out as well.

Triplex - (3) 2bed/1ba; 
Rent: 900/unit = 2700/mo
Mortgage = 1300/mo
Estimated Value: 350,000

3147,Advice for a 21 Year Old,"Good morning everyone I would appreciate everyone’s opinion and advice. 

As of right now I’m at 21 year old male. I currently live with my folks and I have a truck note and storage unit for items once I move away i would already have. Now I been wanting to buy a house for a while as of right now I have a bit of capital but ideally if I were to get a property I would look somewhere around 75k - 150k somewhere a long those lines. My goal would be minimum 20% down to avoid PMI. I would perfer my house mortgage to be no more 1000$ if not somewhere very close to those lines.

I make 24$ hourly should be getting a raise soon as well but, my gross is 3840$ a month. 

Take home: 756.86 

(Keep in mind 6% is also taken away from my check weekly towards 401k and that’s what I keep weekly) ^  

$ 3027.44 
Would be my monthly take home monthly 

Currently I pay 

Truck Note:    697.48 
Storage Unit:  140.00 
Spotify: 11
Gym: 10 

Total: 858.48 

Closer to 1,000$ I get help with phone bill and truck insurance. 

Debt: 36,308.83 (Truck) 
Credit cards: always pay them off 


Should I focus on paying of my truck first which would be the smart thing to do of course the Ramsey way.

As of right now I’m at 21 year old male. I currently live with my folks and I have a truck note and storage unit for items once I move away i would already have. Now I been wanting to buy a house for a while as of right now I have a bit of capital but ideally if I were to get a property I would look somewhere around 75k - 150k somewhere a long those lines. My goal would be minimum 20% down to avoid PMI. I would perfer my house mortgage to be no more 1000$ if not somewhere very close to those lines.

I make 24$ hourly should be getting a raise soon as well but, my gross is 3840$ a month. 

Take home: 756.86 

(Keep in mind 6% is also taken away from my check weekly towards 401k and that’s what I keep weekly) ^  

$ 3027.44 
Would be my monthly take home monthly 

Currently I pay 

Truck Note:    697.48 
Storage Unit:  140.00 
Spotify: 11
Gym: 10 

Total: 858.48 

Closer to 1,000$ I get help with phone bill and truck insurance. 

Debt: 36,308.83 (Truck) 
Credit cards: always pay them off 


Should I focus on paying of my truck first which would be the smart thing to do of course the Ramsey way.

I'm looking to max out my 401k plan and take advantage of my employer's 401k match (dollar for dollar, first 4%), however, I don't want to max it out too early and miss out on any employer matching contributions. Income is Base + Commission and can vary by $30k-$50k based on my sales performance. 

**Example Income:** $100,000 Annually

**Example Match:** dollar for dollar, first 4%

**Scenario 1:** $100,000 contributing across each paycheck consistently will equal matching contributions of $4,000 annually. ($22,500 myself + $4,000 match = $26,500 total)

**Scenario 2:** $100,000 total income and maxes out contributions 6-months in will only receive $2,000 in matched funds. ($22,500 from myself + $2,000 match = $24,500 total)

Because I have a variable income, I can't simply divide the annual maximum of $22,500 out over 26 equal paychecks.

3179,Should I always prioritize retirement over the present?,"Looking through guidelines of how to spend your income (assuming all debts are paid), it's usually 401k match, emergency fund, maximize HSA, maximize roth IRA and then if anything's left over maximize 401k and then put anything over and above into a taxable account. The problem is for most people this isn't realistic if they aren't making 6 figures. Most people cannot afford this, and so it leaves open the question of whether they can enjoy any of their money at present.

In my current situation, I am single, I make around 75k in a pretty affordable city, I bought a house few years ago, made a 20% down payment and I can live within my means. I have saved up a sizeable emergency fund, and with contributing the match (6% contribution, with 10% match for a total of 16%), maxing HSA ($237.5 per month this year) and maxing out my roth ($541.66 per month this year), I end up with around $400-$500 left every month. This is a reasonable amount, but I'm not accounting for any vacation spending in here. If I travel once a year with my family (they live overseas), it costs me around $5k with hotels, flights and other spending, so if I want to leave my emergency fund intact and not touch any of the retirement accounts, I am cutting it very close. These prices also go up with inflation.

I was thinking about this within the context of a trade-off between maximizing my roth IRA and putting money into a taxable investment account with a moderate risk investment strategy. While it is true that you lose tax benefits when you invest in a normal taxable investment account, you can also have access to earnings quicker without having to pay fines and enjoy some of that money now. At some point it feels like investing in a roth IRA has benefits, but if I don't live that long, I will have potentially foregone money I should have used to get more out of my current life than accumulating it for a future I may not have. Furthermore, if I'm less healthy to be able to enjoy the money in retirement then it will also be a bit of a waste.

Does anyone think it's a good idea to invest some funds in a taxable account before maxing out your roth IRA contributions? It seems like at a certain point a 4% return on average in a short span of time that you can access may outweigh a bigger return later that you cannot access immediately and for reasons outside of your control may not be able to.",FinancialPlanning,"Should I always prioritize retirement over the present?

I am starting on an infrastructure team, but would like to eventually do a rotation with the ML/AI team because that was my true passion in school. My starting salary is $83,000 plus an $8,500 sign on bonus and a 4% yearly incentive bonus. I have a 6% matching 401k since i started as an intern with the company. 

Coming from my background, I am very grateful for the amount I will be making,  however I do have a sizable amount of student loans I have to pay off. If I put in 3 years at aforementioned company, they’ll pay for me to get my mba, which I plan to do to eventually work my way into a management position. 

My question is for anyone who has experience navigating making decent money out of the gate coming from a less fortunate background:
Other than improving my technical skills and providing good work during these next 3 years while I wait to get my mba, what else can I do to improve my financial situation/ future prospects? Are there any steps you took that worked well for you in your early career to improve your financial situation and career outlook, or steps you wish you didn’t take? 

I know this is a very subjective topic, but I come from a family and background where this amount of money out of college is unheard of, so just hearing what others did in a scenario like this would help because I don’t really have anyone to talk about it with irl.

3194,Take Control of Your Finances: The Importance of Financial Planning,"Financial planning is a way to manage your money so that you can reach your long-term financial goals. Take charge of your money and make sure you're on the right path to financial stability and independence.

Here are some tips to get you started on your path to financial planning:
1. Figure out your current financial situation by taking stock of your income, expenses, debts, and assets.
Set realistic financial goals. Think about what you want to do with your money, like save for retirement, buy a home, or pay off debt.
3. Make a budget. A budget helps you keep track of what you spend and makes sure you don't spend more than you can afford.
4. Put money into yourself by going to school, getting training, or learning new skills. This will help you make more money and secure your financial future.
Diversify your investments. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Instead, invest in different types of assets to lower your risk.
6. Look at your plan often and make changes as needed. Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it's important to look at your plan often and make changes as needed.

3195,Survived the early tech layoffs but still prepping for the worst,"TL;DR on the fence about spending $30k to payoff my car vs continue paying the minimum in a looming layoff environment.

I'm at one of the big firms that have recently laid off 10k+ workers. I'm relieved that I wasn't impacted but the anxiety is real among those of us who are left. This led me to rethink my financial situation for the year. 

I like to think that I'm relatively financially responsible doing ~40% monthly savings rate. My breakdown is:

84% investments (mostly index ETFs), 401k, including kids 529
16% cash and HYSA with a 15 month expenses runway
Maxing 401k
Maxing Roth IRA

In light of the recent layoffs, my biggest insecurities are now my two big ticket recurring expenses. They're my mortgage and auto loan. Both are low interest with my mortgage at 2.71% and my car at 3.41%.

I follow this thread a lot and agree on taking advantage of my low interest and paying the minimum. But another part of me also imagines the relief of paying off the car as this could free up my 2nd largest monthly expense ($30k left in the loan). I keep going back and forth on paying it outright for peace of mind. In contrast if I just keep paying the minimum, I would be paying ~$9k this year (it's a used EV that we plan of using for the next decade+).

So I'm on the fence of pouring the extra $21k to pay off my car and not worry about car payments anymore or sticking with the min payments that I'd have to continue paying even if I'm out of a job in the near future because who knows what will happen. I'd be using about 5 months worth of my savings leaving me with 10 month runway in savings.

I'm also aware of the opportunity cost but I'm most likely going to be conservative this year and keeping most of my current/future earnings in my HYSA (so you could say it will continue to grow no matter which direction I go).",FinancialPlanning,"Survived the early tech layoffs but still prepping for the worst TL;DR on the fence about spending $30k to payoff my car vs continue paying the minimum in a looming layoff environment.

I'm a 36F who  makes roughly 79K a year working in the non-profit sector. This amount is likely (finally!) to increase within the next year.   
I have a 401 K through  work which I contribute to regularly and will currently increase my contributions.  
I also have a 1,600 mortgage in a HCOL city plus a decent nest-egg/o-shit fund (I won't specify the amount, other than it would get me by for 8 months if I stayed in the city if something happened with my job and 2 years if I moved back home  LCOL country to wait out any financial storm).

My monthly expenses are pretty minimal since I cook at home a lot, don't have a car, have no student loan payments and no real credit card debt.

I've always wanted to invest or at least figure out how to grow my nest egg but the process seems so nebulous.  I tried figuring out Robinhood but it seemed so informal and geared to a specific type of investor. I don't really have time to track the ups and downs of stocks, so I'd love to find something a little less intensive.  What websites/brokerage firms would you recommend? What should a person who is just starting on this track invest in? What amount should I put into a starter project like this (1K? 5K? 10k?)?

I currently have a Roth IRA with M1Finance with about $8k and a JP Morgan Wealth Management account with about $50k. 

I’m trying to learn and understand how my current and future funds should be allocated. I’ve been doing research and crunching numbers. I’m seeing that my percentage gains/loses for my Roth are similar or a little better than my JPM Wealth Management accounts. I feel like I should take the money out of JPM (since I also pay an advisory fee) and use that to get some Vanguard Index Funds. 

Additionally I recently started saving money for investing in real estate, so I’d like to use a bit of that $50k to put aside for some real estate savings as a starting point. 

I know that my Index funds would have majority of my funds so I feel like I should have them in a Roth IRA for tax benefits. But I also know that I’m really close to the income threshold of not being able to use my Roth anymore. 

I’m also assuming my job will give me a 401K, which would now give me like 3 different retirement accounts which seems like overkill. And I’m confused as to where 401k’s are held.

I am looking to buy a new Porsche Taycan. The total price of the car is about 125k after title and registration and all the features I want. I am 16 years old and this will be my first car. I use to run a shoe wholesale company where I would sell in bulk quantities to stores but recently left that business since it wasn't as profitable as it use to be. I do amazon FBA using OA and wholesale methods. Right now that is doing about 80-90k in retune and about 20k on a bad month and 40k on a really good month. I am looking to finance this car and hopefully write it off if I am able to through my company.

My terms are 25k down at 3.2% APR (Hopefully) and a monthly payment of about 2,300 per month. My parents have a 740 credit score . that isn't even including insurance which I am sure will be about $800 per month since i'm a 16 year old guy  bringing my monthly total to $3100 per month.

That all being said my income is about 4k per month after maxing my 401k contribution and health insurance deductions etc. My 401k is sitting at around 50k and I was considering taking 10k out to pad my savings for a worst case scenario type issue. As you can see by my budget breakdown right now with costs im about breaking even and our finances are separate until we get married (4mo’s she makes significantly more than I do).

I know that they will let me take out money from my 401k for a first time home purchase penalty free, but I don’t know if it’s worth it. My salary is set to go up about 5% soon, and I’m getting a roughly 3k bonus in March plus whatever we get back from the wedding and combines assets. 

Would you all recommend just riding it out until the spring? Or should I take a withdrawal to pad my savings?"
3253,Should I pay off personal loan or credit card debt?,"I’ll be getting 9k back in taxes. I took out a 10k personal loan 4 months ago to consolidate my credit cards. Ended up divorcing after 15 years and had to use my cards.

Either way I’ll be paying the secondary debt off as well throughout the year so I’m debt free but just seeing what best option could be.

I’m 35/m in Texas. I started my own company about 2 years ago, and am doing pretty good.  In 2021 year my business made about 400k, and my net is about 300k.

I do not see my business dying out anytime soon, as I work in the restoration, natural disaster segment in a really good location with plenty of natural disasters.

I come from a long line of adventurous, bankrupt dummies. Trying to break the cycle and model some respectable decision-making so my kid doesn’t grow up to be completely ridiculous, too.

Please be my role models. Please drop some beautiful financial wisdom on me!! And also, please be kind. 

————-————-————-————-————-

I’m on the verge of a life change (new state/house/lifestyle) and I need some guidance so as not to completely blow it.

Here’s the scoop:
I’m the “breadwinner” for a family of three (+5 cats + a dog).

I make 140k/year (salary) + an additional $23k/year (VA disability payments).

I tried to figure out the 50/30/20 rule, but mine looks more like 80/30/0. Which is problematic not only because I’m *not* saving, but also because 80% + 30% = 110%, and (surprise!) the extra 10% is coming from credit cards. 

Despite our obviously not-good credit card situation, we are technically spending the prescribed amount (30%). Which to me indicates that our spending isn’t really out of control? Rather, it seems I need to focus on getting the 80% (“needs”) down to 50% where it belongs. (That’s my thinking, anyway?)

So what does my 80% “needs” look like?
-2 new cars (25k purchase + 35k lease) = 410/month + 495/month
[We had ancient cars that both died within a few months of each other, hence 2 new cars]
-Student loans (Originally 200k, but now only 11k left to pay!)
-Budget $1200/month for groceries.
-Budget $600/month for pet food. They eat… so much.
-Utilities (power, gas, water, trash) + internet is around 500-700/month, depending on the season
-Credit card 1 = 15k @ 18% = $300/month
-Credit card 2 = 25k @ 14% = $515/month
-Personal loan 1 = 25k @ 0% (will be paid in full in a few months)
-Personal loan 2 = 6k @ 16% = $680/month (will be paid in full in a few months)
-Car insurance = $112/month
-Pre-school = $170/month
-Phones = $175/month
-Mortgage = $2k/month, for now

I’m probably missing a few things, because ultimately it adds up to over $7k in monthly payments (out of my $9056 monthly pay). It needs go be closer to $4.5k/9k…

We currently live in the middle of nowhere on some acreage in the woods. But, PLOT TWIST, we’re moving to another state (non-negotiable) where we’ll be living in the city (we’re city people at heart, so this isn’t as crazy as it sounds).

Here’s the scoop on that:
-Current mortgage is 380k @ 2.75%, which comes out to $2k/month including insurance/taxes
-New mortgage will be 340k @ 6.25% (eesh) or $2.8k/month including insurance/taxes (I plan to refinance if ever rates are good again)

Because of the difference in taxes and utilities, and because we’ll be paying down some debt, the amount we owe monthly won’t actually change much after we move, despite the steep mortgage increase.

We will make ~$100k profit when our house sells. This sounds huge, but it’s essentially already spoken for (broker’s fees, closing costs, *30k of personal loans*, *15k of credit card debt*, new house improvements, and my daughter’s education).

SO:
-What do I change to fix things so that I’m not stuck at 80/30/0 forever? I really feel like the money is there - I’m just not doing it right??
-How do I actually SAVE money? (I do have a 401k, but I don’t have emergency savings)
-Should I sell my (beloved) car (mine is the cheaper one, and it’s also a much better city car, but the other car is on lease for another 2 years).
Background: My husband is a stay-at-home dad and I work (mostly) from home, but need to drive into the office (1.5 hours away) a few times a month (never scheduled, sort of “on call.”)
Even though neither of us needs to drive often, when we do, it’s usually at the same time. Also, my husband doesn’t like to be left without a car at home in case there’s an emergency of some sort. But I think this might change when we live in the city.

-What things am I not considering that I should be?

3272,LOANing a Friend Money to Help with Debt,"I had a random thought earlier today, and figured I'd look into it a bit. This is just hypothetical, so I don't actually have any real numbers here (so I'll make some up)...

* Let's say I have a friend who has $5,000 of credit card debt at 20%
   * they have a steady job and they've been paying off the debt consistently 
* Of the money I keep in my Check/Savings/HYSA, I could afford to part with $5,000
   * I'd like to see it back, but I don't *need* to
   * I'd otherwise just leave it in an HYSA at \~4% interest

What reasons would either of us have for not wanting to give a friendly loan at 5% (for example)?

* My friend would be able to pay off CC debt immediately
* My friend would now owe me, but at a much easier to manage rate
* I would be making 1% more than if I didn't do this

**It seems like a win-win**

Now, I always see, ""don't loan your friends money"", as then the friendship can feel like a business at times. I also understand that you should never lend anything that you aren't prepared to lose.

Debt just puts you so far behind. Doing this ""friendly loan"" seems like a very low risk for me, with a very large gain for them - and hopefully a slight win for me.

* Worst case, they don't pay me back and it messed up our friendship
   * I wouldn't do this if I didn't trust them enough, and if they betray that, then that's on them
* Best case, they're in a much better spot and I'm in a slightly better spot

.

* What reasons would you see for **me** not wanting to do this?
* What reasons would you see for **my friend** not wanting to do this?

Debt just puts you so far behind. Doing this ""friendly loan"" seems like a very low risk for me, with a very large gain for them - and hopefully a slight win for me.

* Worst case, they don't pay me back and it messed up our friendship
   * I wouldn't do this if I didn't trust them enough, and if they betray that, then that's on them
* Best case, they're in a much better spot and I'm in a slightly better spot

.

**So the question is...**

* What reasons would you see for **me** not wanting to do this?
* What reasons would you see for **my friend** not wanting to do this?

It just seems like a win-win with the only risk being how confident I am that they'll be able to keep their end of the bargain. Am I missing something here?

And again, to be clear again...this is a hypothetical situation. Numbers are made up. I was just looking for people's thoughts on this..."

3274,To pay off car loans or to not?,"Good day, me and my wife make approximately 190k a year. We have roughly the 90k in savings(excluding 401k’s). We have two car loans that is our only debt other than the mortgage. One car loan is 34k at 2.75% the other is 6000 at 5%. I’m definitely going to be paying off the smaller loan but have a great interest on the 34k loan so am unsure if we should pay off that vehicle with the cash or let the roughly 73k we have in investments keep accumulating(adding 1000 a month too it).

3281,Should I sell the car I just started financing,"I started financing a 2018 Honda Civic in November. I think my loan had 20% interest, so I pay $482 a month for 60 months. I’m a teenager and ended up crashing my moms car last year. I got insurance for this car on my own and it’s insanely high, $682 a month for the next 5 months. That’s $1,164 a month just for my car. I wouldn’t mind the car payment but that insurance is just absurd.

Plus I just moved out so now I’m paying $1,800 a month for my apartment. These combined with my other expenses (food, subscriptions, wifi, etc.) leave me with below $700 a month for saving/investing. Not to mention I have to buy furniture so funds are super tight right now.

Of course the logical thing to do is sell my car but I use it on a daily basis (nothing too serious, just for convenience) and would have to go without a car for months while I save up for a cheaper one.

I watch a lot of Graham Stephan on YouTube and stuff and he usually says try to save 50% of your income, so being able to save less than 15% feels terrible.

Is $700 a month even enough for saving? Especially considering all my expenses. Should i sell the car or just keep paying the insurance and see if it gets cheaper after the 5 months are up?

Baby was a wanted surprise but I would have wanted to wait a few more years to get a larger nest egg under us prior to giving birth.
We both live in a foreign country so have no family to assist and were under the impression we wouldn’t get gov help with parental leave so saved up 7K for baby stuff and doctors etc (thankfully I ended up getting the leave but the majority of it went towards rent).
I think we probably would be a bit better off if we hadn’t of booked a trip back to his home country at the beginning of last year to see his family (post covid)….a lot of money went towards paying for bills while we are away, spending money etc


We aren’t poor but we are poor if you understand lol, me being out of work for 7 months has hit us hard and we went through that 7K a bit too fast for my liking. We have zero savings now and only some investment money which I am really depressed about touching but most likely will have to…


I start back at work in March as PT (3 days a week for now) and partner is working full time.
Together we earn 52k and 58k at our jobs, we have no debt and are generally very good at saving (I always aim to save 30-40% of my pay).
We have minimal subscriptions (only Spotify and Netflix) and pay for car insurance and partners health insurance (I will need to get insurance this year also).

I also have quite a bit of money saved up from just gifts and all that, and also from online studies/research studies that I do for extra cash. 

I know that isn't a lot, but I also can't sacrifice much time because of schoolwork. Besides, I don't have to worry about food/bills (I love with my parents and don't eat by myself at all), gas (I am in-charge of taking my siblings to sports/school/other stuff so my parents cover for gas), and my options for college next year are at two schools where I can go for either full tuition or a full-ride (so my parents would be able to use my college fund on at most my housing/food/books/etc;). I also am good on a car bc (so long as nothing bad happens) I have a vehicle that should last me well after I have an actual job. 

I also have a debit card (so savings and checking accounts) w/ money on it but the only things I really ever use if for are toiletries or to run to the store or other errands for my parents. And they usually compensate on what I bought for them. 

So my question is: what should I do with this money? I want to save it and be smart, but I don't rlly know what to do with it? Should I just put it in my savings account?

3367,Advice on a credit score scenario (UK),"Hi everyone!

I have a hypothetical scenario I would like to run by you in the hope that you could give me insight into what this will do to my credit score.

My credit score is currently 908/999. The average age of credit accounts is 29 months.

I have been toying with the idea of applying for a Barclays credit card - not because I need more credit, but because I (1) have heard they are more likely to give mortgages to non-UK citizens when the time comes to purchase a home, and (2)  you can earn Avios points with the credit card. 

I also need a new phone. Mine is just broken at this point, and I begrudgingly have been looking at contracts to buy a new phone from the mobile network I am currently signed up to (pay as you go - no credit line currently). 

What will happen if I pursue both of these options? I know it will negatively impact my score as it is two new lines of credit, but is it better to pursue both and take one big knock or stagger them? 

I know the UK assesses the average age of credit accounts. My current logic says I should get both at the same time and rebuild to salvage as much as I can in terms of time. But are there other risks I may be missing? Please flag them if you can think of anything.

3372,Can I Afford This Car/Does it Make Any Sense?,"Hey guys, I am hoping to get some general guidance here before I seriously consider pursuing a new vehicle. I also want to headline by saying that I am an advisor by profession and have learned that more eyes are better than my own. Now some numbers:

I have an income range of $99-$125k depending on VC. I currently save 22% of all income to a retirement + $1000 a year in an HSA. I also am able to save and invest about $10000+ a year in cash/brokerage pretty easily at my worst income years. I currently am 26 with just over $10k in money market/stocks at about a 50/50 split. I don’t have a lot to show for yet although I expect to triple my savings this year and I also feel on target for my age for retirement (26 with about $40k saved in 401k invested properly)

For expenses it is currently $1000 for rent, and $600 all in for my utilities (phone, internet, TV, Car insurance, Health, gas, electric, etc). Food can range for me but typically falls between $100-$200 a week. Outside of that I am at a net profit every month of around $4000. I have just started making this income so I expect to grow assets very well and also be able to absorb expenses very well. 

Only debt I have is $24k of federal student loans (maybe $10k is forgiven but I’m not holding my breath). My company also pays down some of the loans (their payment is more than my minimum). 

Now here’s the fun part. The car dealer I have service my car sent me a letter saying they will give me a $12k trade in offer + $1000 from the dealer as a down payment on a 2.9% APR 60 month loan. My car is good but getting a little older and will need some work this year. For the car people I have a 2015 Honda Accord LX with 100.5k miles on it. It will need $2000 of work this year as well. The dealer has a 2023 Civic Sport brand new for $25.5k. It would serve me well for an easy 8-10 years considering my experience with my accord. I figure if I can but $2.5k down + my trade in + their $1k down I might be able to finance $10k at the 2.9% and then work to pay it down. 

Thoughts? I think it’s too good to be true but if I can’t get the Civic for $10k financed then I’m out imo. I value saving in my 20s but I feel this could be a decent side step to get a newer car that I can keep and maintain well. 

Also for reference I bought this Accord with 33k on the odometer for my life savings in 2018 of $11.5k. I put a lot of miles on it for work but now I work from home most of the time and my work is not that far away anymore.

Hello! 
My parents are both elderly, my mom is in good health however my dad has many health problems and has had many strokes that affect his cognitive ability. Pre-strokes he had a great career where he earned a good amount of money, however he spent it as quick as it came in. My mother has some money and has been very wise with it. Our worry is that, if she passes before him, he will blow through the money in a matter of months (maybe a year). In our province (Manitoba, Canada) it is law that she leaves half of her estate to him. But is there some kind of trust or something we can put it in where he can only access some of it at a time?  He was not a great father so none of us children want to be saddled with supporting him if he does blow through it all. 
Any ideas or suggestions would help. My mothers lawyer told her there was nothing she could do but surely there is something.",FinancialPlanning,"Help with planning a financial future for my disabled father

3407,(26M) Rent vs. Own - Living Area,"Was hoping to get insight on whether I should aim to rent / own my first place out of college. Here's some details on my current living situation:

Location: Tampa, FL

Salary: $93k (very stable job, guaranteed annual raises)

**Expenses**

Current Rent: $650/month

Car: Fully paid off, still around 60k miles

Phone: Covered by work

Debt: None other than $20k in school loans, waiting on repayment to start back again in October

Misc: Other than food and other necessities, I don't spend much. I work my full-time job and have a small part-time job on the weekends. Second job doesn't make a lot, but it keeps me from spending money on going out and such.

**Goals**

Really hoping to get a place of my own. Living with roommates has begun to take a toll over the years and I'd like to work on improving my quality of life overall. Things like I love learning how to cook, but three lifestyles going on at once can make that difficult.

Just trying to decide if it would be better to take on a mortgage and try to build equity or find a place to rent for now. Also, with the housing market being where it's at, I'm really unsure what to expect in the coming years. Especially in my location.

**Current Plans**

So as of right now, I've been leaning heavily towards renting since housing prices are so high right now. In addition, I would really like to move closer to my office in downtown as well. Unfortunately though, it seems like downtown is out of question since rent, before add-ons, seems to start around $2k/month (300-600 sqft) which is nearly half my monthly income.

That being said, I've been considering moving towards the Brandon area, about 15 minutes from the office. I've been looking at one starting at $1,755/month (900 sqft). Just not sure if renting is still the best option, and also what dollar amount I should aim for.

I have exactly enough left in my savings and checking all my accounts to pay off this truck where I was living prior to my sisters so my question is should I go into the apartment and have savings but slowly they get eaten up and they most certainly will get eaten up more with my own apartment. Or pay off the truck lower my insurance and have the extra 300 dollars a month for rent and things if I did this I would have zero savings ..

I’ve thought a lot about selling the truck it’s a Tacoma in great condition and I don’t drive I get driven once a month to my care so I need a vehicle I really think this one would hold value so I’m not sure on that

Planning to put a $ 1 Million offer on a house (20% downpayment) which will be close to a monthly mortgage of $ 7 k including property tax. (6% interest rate) 

Our remaining savings after downpayment and closing costs would be $ 100k+. 

I was aiming for a mortgage of $ 5- 6k per month and I think $ 7k monthly mortgage payment seems high as it will leave only savings of $ 4K after other expenses(6k).   

currently our rent is less than $ 4k which we can continue to live as baby is less than 2 years and we don’t need to move to a good school district next couple of years. 

If interests come down then mortgage payment might come slightly and as baby starts going to school will save the daycare costs. Both together might lead to additional $ 2k - 2500 savings.

Last year, I opened a Roth IRA account through Vanguard and deposited the maximum amount of $6,000 into it. I am currently dollar cost averaging into S&amp;P trackers like VOO with that money. I plan to deposit the max amount into my IRA again this year.

On top of all of this, I still have around $37k total sitting in my bank account. I feel like I should be doing something with that money. I have received suggestions before telling me to try to save up for a down payment on something small and rent it out while I'm still working on my studies and living with my parents. I am not sure if that is something realistic to try to aim for. Perhaps just saving my money is enough for now?

Full Context:
Me and my wife make $120K together, in our area we are using chfa and this type of loan gives us a forgivable 2nd loan. Only if my wife does it, I make too much to qualify for it.

Homes we’ve looked at:
The homes we’ve seen are for the most part in a suburban city.

Taxes yearly here on average are $3,000+ and because of chfa pmi is reduced.
-----
What do we do?:
We have a free 25K for a down payment towards any home. Should we save the money we would have used towards the repairs of the house and put it in a high yield savings or do we just pay the remaining portion of the 20% and just keep whatever else we have and we should be fine regardless?
-----
What will we purchase / do in the future?:
I mean year one of purchasing a house I'm sure we'd do repairs and then relax, the year after probably have a kid and get a new car probably 30K+ on the car alone. And I think that'd be the majority of expenses also one of us will probably go back to college so school expenses.

**Where I need help: 

With our combined income, I am battling what to do with our IRA’s, stay trad or move back door to Roth. Only reason I haven’t yet is because I am working towards retiring from the full corporate environment early, shooting for 50-55 and feel that the closer I get to retirement, the more I would like to transition out of sales and do something a little more enjoyable, possibly work at local golf courses. Of course this would be a big pay cut but our tax rate would also drop significantly, would continue to work part time for benefits and consistent income coming in to help. I figure by the time we begin withdrawing from the IRA accts, our tax rate will be significantly lower then it would if I paid the taxes on it right now by converting to a Roth. Basically don’t know if paying taxes in the prime of my career is smart.

 It was a accident. I was trying to deposit money to my checking account to pay a bill but didn't notice it sent the money to my second account before I paid it and now I'm in the negative. Will the money be refunded after the negative balance paid off?  I'm not sure how it works."

3451,Would liquidating stocks to buy an investment home/business be a silly idea?,"The circumstances of my life have changed drastically in the past few years and it’s time for me to buy a “forever” home. I found one that might be perfect. 

It is a 3-floor home in the center of town (good retail space):
•1st floor small apartment that can rent for 2k/mo  
•2nd floor studio space that I will use for work - conservatively will make $7,000/mo year round  
•3rd floor apartment that I will live in or rent for 3k/mo if I need a bigger space
•huge garden area to grow food  

I have money to buy this house outright, but have to liquidate stocks that are sitting roughly around where they were in 2019 (like everyone else, I lost lots of money in the market the past year) I have lost roughly what I will pay for the house. 

My income now comes from renting a house that I own that is 5 min from this home and seasonal work in the summer. This would increase my income by that $7000/mo + $2,000/mo if I choose to rent the bottom right away (don’t really need the money at the moment, so maybe I will have my mom move in to help me) 

Right now in my area I am paying $4,000/mo for a 1 bed apartment and only working seasonally because I don’t have a studio space in the winter. I own the other home that I rent outright (no mortgage) &amp; the cash purchase of this home will take 1/5 of the stock portfolio I would have to pull from. 

Is it worth it to liquidate stocks that have hugely decreased in price to make this happen, or is it best to hold off for a few more years?

Potential cons:
This house has been on the market for a year as it’s not a functional home for a family, it will only work for someone with a vision for business. My first offer (declined) was $200k less than asking because of this. They bought it for essentially what I offered them roughly 20 years ago, so it seems there isn’t much growth potential in the property value for this one, but lots of opportunity to make money from it from a business perspective + it will be harder to sell than a normal house in the area.",FinancialPlanning,"Would liquidating stocks to buy an investment home/business be a silly idea?

I’m a 24 year old nurse and my income for the 2022 year was $86k.
I just received a raise where I will be in the 24% tax bracket for the 2023 year. 

I currently have $28k in private student loans and approx. $40k in government student loans.
I have a private loan for my car, approx. $12k.

I currently have $7k in a savings account and my monthly expenses are approx. $2.2k (including loan payments).

I have just spent the last year and a half building a credit score and have met my goal, yay! And now have 3 months of living expenses in my savings account for emergency funds.

At this point, I think I’m ready to start investing. However, I do have a ton of student loans (I may have to start paying the government loans after the grace period this year) and this will change my monthly expenses throughout the next few years.

My job currently provides a 403b, but from my understanding this would not be a good idea for investment as I plan to leave this job in 2 years and they do not match contributions. 

So, I was looking into rIRA and tIRA. I plan to go back to school, an expected raise of income to around $120k at least depending on NP school or CRNA school once I pay off my current private loans.

Doing some research, expecting a raise of income throughout my life, the rIRA makes more sense because of my change in tax brackets and potential for future 401k investments after a job change.

Is this correct? Is rIRA my best choice right now?

Are there any other things I should look into to meet my goal of a reasonable retirement age? (50-60 y.o)

3479,Good idea to transfer my traditional 401k into my Roth IRA this year? ~3x Lower income and planning to buy a property.,"Hello everyone, 

I’ve been reading tons of posts and watching lots of videos but I want to make sure it’s the most correct decision. 

I’m 25 and quit my job in 2022 to continue my education. I want to move over my traditional 401K from my previous employer into my current Roth IRA with fidelity. 

I predict my income this year will be about 3x lower than my previous years income. I’m also planning to purchase a townhouse in 1-2 months.

Would it make sense to move that 401k this year? I’m not sure how my lowered income or purchasing a property will affect the amount of money I would have to pay in taxes if I moved the 401k in the same year.",FinancialPlanning,"Good idea to transfer my traditional 401k into my Roth IRA this year? ~3x Lower income and planning to buy a property.

3481,Is Using Leverage as a Small Part of Your Investment Portfolio Safe?," Hey,

I currently have all of my investments in VOO, and I feel pretty safe about it. I've seen a lot of talk about leverage recently, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to commit to something like the Hedgefundie strategy. So, I was wondering if doing something like 80% VOO and 20% UPRO would make sense.

I've heard a lot of people talk about decaying and all that, but generally speaking, the stock market goes up around 53.3% of days and down 46.7% of days, with up days usually outperforming most down days from data spanning decades. So, I would think that since the market will probably go up, having 20% into something like UPRO would make sense to potentially 1.5x my ROI?

Would appreciate any advice on whether I'm just dumb or if this is not bad.",FinancialPlanning,"Is Using Leverage as a Small Part of Your Investment Portfolio Safe?  Hey,

This is my first car purchase, I was just wondering what others have done or their philosophy on their first car. I've been looking to purchase used vehicles just off lease with out the door prices of 21k to 24k. However, I sometimes wonder if I don't need to spend that much, and I should just get something cheaper and save for something bigger (real estate). I will need a car by the time I'm ready to move out, since my sibling will be taking the family car. It just feels unsettling to have \~25% of my net worth locked up in a depreciating asset (albeit a necessary one), even when I know I could afford the monthly payments for a 36 month loan.

It is a 3-floor home in the center of town (good retail space):

Hi. I live in a very high cost of living (VHCOL) area. My husband and I both work full time and just bought a condo at a 2% mortgage interest rate. We’ve always been very careful to live within our means, but I feel like we’ve reached a bit of a plateau with our personal finances recently. 

I contribute 20% to my 401(k) with a 6% match and my husband contributes 6% to his with a 6% match. The reason for the disparity is an effort to get our 401(k)s to similar levels - he’s had his much longer. 

My husband also takes part in his Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) at 10% and regularly gets small Restricted Stock Units (RSU). 

Together, based on our W-2s, we earned $229,466.30 in 2022. This includes our bonuses, and, I think, the RSUs and ESPP. Our tax bracket is 24% ($30,427.00 plus 24% after $178,150, so $42,742.91 for 2022). 

We own outright two vehicles, but despite all efforts my husband’s beloved old family van is on its last leg and will likely be replaced with an electric or hybrid vehicle when it dies.

Minimum payments on those are ~$1600/mo I believe). I also have car insurance which is about $200/mo. I own my car so no payments on that. Other expenses are pretty minimal, i have a couple subscriptions for things like Netflix and disney plus but those might add up to be ~$100/mo if I'm being really conservative with the price (obviously i could cancel these if i got laid off but i like watching my shows so ill keep them for now). Other than this I don't spend much, maybe the occasional go out to eat but my parents take care of all the food and house expenses.

3525,"Ignorant of income limits, I over-contributed to Roth IRA two years in a row. Seeking advice with options","So I unwittingly over-contributed to my (only) Roth IRA for both TY2022 and TY2023. $6k and $6.5k, respectively. My income quickly grew from years prior (gratefully) and I was, up until very recently, unaware of the relevant limitations. 2023 has just begun, but if I keep my current job (I expect to), my AGI for both years was and will be over the limit to be eligible to contribute anything at all to a Roth IRA.

I've already got a (also the only) Traditional IRA comprised of pre-tax money from a previous employer 401k rollover in the amount of $33k.

I presume I will encounter the 6% excise tax penalty for the first time when preparing my taxes for TY2022, so I'd like to mitigate it before I get started on that.

My options, as far as I can tell:

1. Withdraw the total overage using the ""I over-contributed"" reason and eat the 10% penalty, which would amount to ~1.2k
2. Re-characterize those contributions over to the Traditional IRA, and consider implementing the backdoor Roth procedure

I'm a bit fuzzy on (2), but if I understand it correctly, I can, if I wish, roll those funds _back_ into the Roth IRA at a later date (when...?), and work around the Roth IRA contribution limit each tax year using the same procedure (Roth-&gt;Traditional-&gt;Roth). I'll owe income tax on a pro-rated basis for any pre-tax money that was in the Traditional IRA when rolling back into Roth characterization. If I did this procedure later this year, I would add ~9.2k of taxable income for TY2023, and need to pay federal and state income taxes on that money at my current marginal rate. Sound right so far?

In the case where I proceed with the re-characterization and backdoor Roth procedure: do I then roll back into the Roth every year, or leave contributions characterized as Traditional until such time that I am eligible and ready to use that money (and possibly in a lower tax bracket), and then roll it? I suppose one downside with waiting could be that the law might change, but if I pay better attention, I'll likely have enough notice before such a change to transition the funds before any new law takes effect.

For context, my larger financial picture is pretty healthy at the moment. I've no debt and a reasonable safety net. My most immediate financial goal is to save a large down payment for a real estate purchase in the coming 1-2 years. If I withdraw the IRA money now and take the penalty, I could realize that savings goal faster. But it's highly unlikely that I'll be ready to buy any sooner than 1 year out for other reasons, and I expect to be able to have that money either way by then (barring unforeseeable extenuating circumstances/catastrophe).

Further questions:

1. Have I understood this correctly?
2. Have I overlooked/not mentioned anything that I ought to be aware of?
3. What do you think is my best course of action given what I have laid out?

Thanks!",FinancialPlanning,"Ignorant of income limits, I over-contributed to Roth IRA two years in a row. Seeking advice with options So I unwittingly over-contributed to my (only) Roth IRA for both TY2022 and TY2023. $6k and $6.5k, respectively. My income quickly grew from years prior (gratefully) and I was, up until very recently, unaware of the relevant limitations. 2023 has just begun, but if I keep my current job (I expect to), my AGI for both years was and will be over the limit to be eligible to contribute anything at all to a Roth IRA.

I've already got a (also the only) Traditional IRA comprised of pre-tax money from a previous employer 401k rollover in the amount of $33k.

I presume I will encounter the 6% excise tax penalty for the first time when preparing my taxes for TY2022, so I'd like to mitigate it before I get started on that.

My options, as far as I can tell:

1. Withdraw the total overage using the ""I over-contributed"" reason and eat the 10% penalty, which would amount to ~1.2k
2. Re-characterize those contributions over to the Traditional IRA, and consider implementing the backdoor Roth procedure

I'm a bit fuzzy on (2), but if I understand it correctly, I can, if I wish, roll those funds _back_ into the Roth IRA at a later date (when...?), and work around the Roth IRA contribution limit each tax year using the same procedure (Roth-&gt;Traditional-&gt;Roth). I'll owe income tax on a pro-rated basis for any pre-tax money that was in the Traditional IRA when rolling back into Roth characterization. If I did this procedure later this year, I would add ~9.2k of taxable income for TY2023, and need to pay federal and state income taxes on that money at my current marginal rate. Sound right so far?

3527,What Loan Type Do New Build Spec Homes in a Development Use?,"I apologize if this isn’t the best place to ask or if the answer is out there - a little Google digging didn’t clearly answer it for me.   
  
I understand that to build a home (custom, spec, or other) on your own plot of land you need a construction loan and the land paid for to use as collateral.   
  
What loan type is required for the “spec home” communities? Essentially, you’re still purchasing land and having a home built on it - although the land is somewhat predetermined and the homes are going to be built regardless, in many cases, to fill the available lots.   
  
Do you have to purchase the plot first with cash prior to commencing the build? What if you purchase a home mid-build? I’d assume that purchasing one of these homes after construction has completed would be no different than a traditional home purchase.

3531,Switch contributions from 401k to 457?,"I’ve been working for a government employee now for about 5 years now. When I started, I didn’t really realize the benefits of a 457 plan versus a 401k, in that you don’t face a 10% penalty for an early withdrawal with the 457 plan. Since my employer offers a pension, they don’t offer any match to my 401k but I mistakenly decided to make contributions of around 7% of my pre-tax salary anyways to that mostly because I had heard of it compared to the 457 plan.

Lately, I’ve been considering changing my future contributions to the 457 plan and am wondering if this is the right move? On the plus side, I could withdrawal from the 457 plan if I need it  (we are trying to buy a house in the next couple of years or if something else comes up in life) but the downside is that I would then pay two account fees. The fee for each is $1.50 a month but I’m wondering if the additional flexibility is worth more or just paying one fee?

Hi everyone - looking for informative opinions on our situation.

Current home - 
Purchased Early 2019 $360,000, currently owe $320,000 at 2.6% with monthly escrow and HOA payment of $1770 in desirable neighborhood of a suburb of a major metro. New house built in 2019 so no major concerns with roof, foundation, etc. HOA handles landscaping for front yard, backyard is drip system, turf and pavers so almost no maintenance. 

Option A:
We can rent this home for approximately $2200-$2500 per month, and know someone interested that is trusted with stable income so we can skip the property management company and just offer at $2200. 

Option B:
We can sell in a declining market, but again still a desirable area. Selling price would probably be $515,000 to $540,000 in the current market. Similar homes in the neighborhood were selling at $680,000 in late 2021, so we have realistic/low expectations with the above numbers. 

So do we capitalize on the equity now or keep the house a few years, knowing we can sell within 5 years of moving and avoid capital gains tax or do we get into the rental game and start building some passive income?

My spouse and I are in our mid 30s, decent 401K accounts ($160k), cash savings of $90k so far for the new house down payment, but need $112k by close date in June. (Already gave builder $72,000 cash for earnest and upgrades)

Income and current bills info:
Combined yearly pretax income - $350k to $450k ($230k to $330k commission sales fluctuate for one income, the other is stable $120k) 
Auto loans and car insurance- $1830/month - two vehicles 
Daycare - $2800/month 
Current Mortgage/escrow/hoa - $1770/month
Phones, streaming apps, and internet - $350/month

We’ve scheduled a meeting with a tax and financial advisor for next month where we’ll also ask questions, but what are the advantages and disadvantages for property management from an income and tax perspective that are major factors we should consider?

Generally we are low risk type people, both grew up in low income environments so we haven’t really seen good financial modeling or have any family to advise or ask, hence Reddit. 

The why: 
We are moving into a bigger home because we are about to become a family of 5 and current house is a 3 bed 2 bath 1565 sqft house where we wfh - it has been just fine for two kids (no guest room, no dining room, no playroom, no separate offices, just all in the kitchen/dining/living spaces) but with three we are going to be a little too tight - so life happens. 

New house - Assuming $20% down. 
Loan of $730k at 5.25% (no buy down)
Mortgage/escrow/hoa - $5025/month

If we max the down payment to 27% that monthly payment drops to $4675/month - without losing the jumbo loan locked in rate of 5.25 from last year - $665k loan.

3549,529 If not planning to use for college,"I want to start investing for my kids. So far I had ruled out 529 as an option and was thinking about UTMA accounts. 

This is mainly due to us likely relocating outside of the US before the kids would go to college. 

My understanding is that there's a 10% penalty on withdrawals that aren't education related. 

I'm wondering if it still makes sense to go ahead with a 529 given the tax benefits (tax deferred growth). I'm thinking this should be a much larger benefit than the 10% fee assuming I liquidate all the positions prior to withdrawal and the time horizon is long enough (10-20 years)

My partner (28) and I currently live with my parents, so we are extremely blessed to not have any rent or utility expenses. She is 8.5 months pregnant (so excited!) so she’s not currently working.

Income:
I make $27,000/yr (in South Carolina) and I take home about $1.8k/mo after taxes (not including commissions, but those go straight into savings). I’ve got about $3,300 in savings right now and my credit score is 709

Debt: 
I have $16,500 in student loans, which are currently deferred (still accruing interest though) which I have not had to make any payments on. I really would be happy if my student debt is cancelled, but i’m definitely going to be ready if that does not happen.

I have only one line of credit open, a Discover card with 0% APR until 06/04/23. I owe about $1,400 on it with a minimum payment of $35/mo, but usually put about $100-$200 into it each month.

Budget:
I provide for both myself and my partner, and soon our little one. We spend about-
$400-$500/mo on groceries (we have WIC so that helps a bit)
$70/mo eating out/date nights
$200/mo gas (drive about 40mins to work one 
way)
$70-$150/mo shopping (baby stuff and miscellaneous needs)

My wife is currently in between jobs, but works as a waitress and takes home about 300/week when working.

While we have an estimated budget, we honestly don't watch our spending when it comes to groceries. We eat what we eat, and we feel that there is value in not limiting ourselves in that regard.

This money is purely her spending money and doesn't factor into our budget when she has a job. Obviously when she doesn't have a job, she is spending more on our joint account, but that is not reflected in this budget.

We have about 16k in savings that is accruing \~3.8% interest, but only a few thousand in 401k. This is because in 2021 we ended up using my 401k to put money down on a home.

While we have an estimated budget, we honestly don't watch our spending when it comes to groceries. We eat what we eat, and we feel that there is value in not limiting ourselves in that regard.

Both our vehicles are paid off, but i did just have to spend around $4k on repairs... so that sort of nullifies the benefit of not having car payments.

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-tax 401k contribution - 8%

Current monthly budget:

Mortgage and HOA: 1750

Utilities/internet: \~245

Phones: 80

Groceries: 1000

auto insurance 95

fuel for cars 300

health/dental insurance 350

shopping/misc needs 500

eating out - 300

&amp;#x200B;

approximate total spending: $4,620/month

approximate net income: $7,400/month

In theory I should have 2,780 left over per month. I haven't had the raise long enough to actually see that money and Christmas was obviously a time of overspending (we went over budget there too), but that is what it should look like ideally.

How much should I budget to save? In the past I have just saved whatever I could when I felt I could. Should I be saving for my kids' college? if so, what is the best way to do that?"

3572,Traditional IRA + Roth IRA max contribution to both in 2022 question.,"I think I know the answer to this already, but wanted to confirm since most articles I have read don’t clearly state it. If I have both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, does the $6,000 max contribution for the year mean that it is split between the two? For example, putting $3,000 into both equaling the total of $6,000 for the year. Or since one is Traditional and the other is a Roth, does it allow you to put in $6,000 into each account?

I’m guessing it is $6,000 total between the two, but I just did a rollover Traditional IRA with an old 401k and wondered if I could put in an extra $6,000 before the tax season gets here. I already hit $6,000 contribution on my Roth IRA for 2022.

I’ve been a lurker here for a while. 
Growing up my family made terrible money AND were terrible with their money as well.

I was never taught anything about how to manage money and so I’m trying to fix my poor habits and start anew. I just got engaged, and I have a wedding due for October ‘24. 

Here is the situation: I’m 26, and I make $60,000 a year salary. I bring home $4,000 a month. I contribute some very low amount ($25) to a Roth IRA I started in after high school through an app called *Acorns*. I work in education, so I have an additional retirement account through TRS, the Teacher Retirement System. My shared bills (or things that I split with my fiancé) are $1449.38 a month. All my personal bills amount to $1092.95. I have $1457.67 to my name after I pay my bills. I use about $200 worth of gas a month and I usually reserve myself $100 a week for things I may need, or to go out to eat for lunch occasionally. That leaves about $800 (rounding) left over. I have no savings as of now.

I have three credit cards, two I have reduced from being maxed out to being empty over the past two months. One sits now at $0/$2500 and one sits at $0/$1800. The other is a medical credit card that sits at $0/$1500. 

I have one student loan in a state where I don’t have to pay on it at the moment. It sits at around $3000. 

I have a car note that sits at $40,000ish.

3579,Opening Roth IRA and investing for the first time. Any advice/tips?,"I'm 23, single and make no more than $1400 a month, I live with my parents so my money has been piling up and sitting in a money market account for years and years and I have no plans to touch it for a very long time. I started looking up ways to make it grow and discovered that I should start planning for retirement and open a Roth IRA and invest in Index Funds.

After looking around I'm interested in opening an account with Vanguard. I've heard that there are limits to how much you can contribute, but also that you can contribute for the previous year and the current year if you do it in the January-April interval. I believe the limit was $6,000 for 2022, and $6,500 for 2023. I am fully capable of comfortably investing up to $12,500 at one time (I have no expenses and have plenty of savings/emergency fund).

I don't want to worry about timing the market, I just know investing something sooner rather than later is best. If I only have until April to contribute for the 2022 year, I imagine I'd have to contribute $6k by lump sum, bump sum, or do dollar-cost averaging by April before the deadline for 2022 contributions. Then I'd have until April 2024 to figure out how and when to invest the maximum $6,500 for the 2023 year.

1. Just to get some insight, what is everyone doing now in terms of lump/bump sum and DCA? I imagine it'd be best to DCA until April (if there is a dramatic drop before then, to lump sum) to be on the safe side.
2. If I open up an account with Vanguard and max out 2022 with a $6k contribution, could I also do share certificates through Vanguard or would that be considered overcontributing? My bank offers share certificates as well but Vanguard has better rates. (So for example could I max out 2022 contributions with $6k and open a share certificate of $5k or so at the same time, or would that count toward my $6.5k contributions for 2023?)
3. And how do I know if I overcontribute? When learning about Roth IRAs I hear this is a common issue, so for my income I wanted to double-check my numbers of $6k by April and an additional $6.5k from now to next April is the maximum. Again I'm single and make no more than $1400 a month, my family has an accountant that files all our taxes for us so I could confirm with them but wanted to know if there was a way to actually check your maximum without just looking at some chart for general use.
4. Do I need to tell my accountant to report my contributions? I've heard about Saver's Tax Credits(?) but I didn't want to bombard them with too many questions.

I'm still new to all of this and wanted to make sure I have the right idea about how Roth IRAs and investing works with share certificates for some extra, safe small returns on the side. If anyone has thoughts on any of the points above or just general tips/advice on beginner investors I'd appreciate it.

I plan on contacting my parents' financial advisor who is also a family friend but again didn't want to bombard them with questions if most of these are considered general questions.

My wife purchased a house in April 2021 where we now live. She and I plan to upgrade houses in 1-2 years - either when the right one comes along or when we find land to build upon.  We would list her home contingent with new home. 
  
My brother wants to buy land and build as his next house, so I/we don’t have any definitive timeframe on him moving out or wanting to sell.   
  
What options do I have for my joint mortgage with my brother? I worry that having 2 mortgages (one is mine, one is my wife’s) will complicate her and I’s process of obtaining a mortgage for our next home.   
  
One option would be to refinance to remove me from the mortgage and deed. Is this the only way? I don’t want to force him into an unfair financial situation as the joint mortgage was a mutual decision initially.   
  
In the eyes of a lender, would it change things on his end when going for his own construction loan if he would refinance in his name only?

Basically, I am considering a transfer to a new position. I’m not sure if my situation warrants a withdraw or potentially transfer and loan out from my 401K. I do not know the pitfalls here and would appreciate any info! 

Brief summary of important info:

- I’m a mid-senior level engineer with a fairly decent job. Paid below the 25% for my area though. 

- I am a final candidate for another position paying significantly more. It requires relocation. Wife and I are ok with that. Not 100%, but feels 80% that I’ll at least secure an offer. It is my dream to work at this place.

- I have side gigs I do that can maintain my current way of living. A personal LLC which pulled me ~$2600 this last week.

- If* it hits the fan I could dip in my 401K as I maxed contributions for years since starting. It is now enough to live off confidently if I took a loan on it.

3597,A lending club transfer nightmare (money markets),"To make a long story short, heres what happened.


January 6th I had $323 in my OCCU money market account. It said I had $323 available balance.

I transfered $300 to my lending club money market that had higher interest.

Lending club got the money and it showed up on my account.

3 days later I had a -$300 on my lending club. I contacted them and they said my bank told them I had insufficient funds and it would have to be returned.

Lendingclub then ""returned"" the money to my OCCU account.

The transaction says ""+$0"". It has been this way since January 9th.

I have contacted both my lending club and OCCU bank and they are both pointing fingers at each other.


I am out $300. What the hell do I do now??

1. Discover - $3k maxed   
2. Bank of America - $3k maxed   
3. Citibank - $1.5k maxed   
all due to automotive repair bills and other misc items. This debt first got accumulated since the summer of 2022 and I have been trying to repay back what I owe but it always climbs back up due to my poor spending habits.   


I currently work making $20/hr in downtown LA and get paid about $3k a month (after taxes) or $1.5k every two weeks.   
My monthly mandatory expenses sum up to about $1.2k and this includes gas, rent, daily $9 parking for work, and bills.  
I live paycheck to paycheck and the way I have been budgeting myself has been like this:   
**biweekly:**   
$1500 check  
$500 for necessities, $500 to pay off credit card with highest interest (BoFa), $200 for myself, and $300 left over for my gas and parking until I get my next paycheck the following 2 weeks. By the end of the 2 weeks, Im left with about less than $100, sometimes even less than $50 right before my next paycheck hits. It makes me depressed lol.   


So in total, Ideally, I'm making about $1000 payments on my debt, but due to my spending habits and going out with friends and my girlfriend, it fluctuates those $1000 to about $500-600 at best towards my debt, monthly. That is essentially what im doing right now and it's not working for me apparently. I haven't made a dent in my debt at all despite almost a year of me having it.  


I am considering selling my only car, a 30 year old honda, and using the money to pay off my debt and just commuting straight to work saving me hundreds on gas and parking. I do have the metro easily accessible for me and it can take me straight to and from work, but I have had a really bad experience with the metro making it uncomfortable and unsettling for me due to the unpredictable people that go on it. In addition, I feel like I will be emotionally distressed as I love my car and really enjoy driving. However, I know if I sell my car it will be financially smart and really alleviate the debt that I have failed to pay for the past 6 months.

I have twenty thousand dollars saved up and about nine thousand dollars in student loans (which have paused payments right now). I am eager to move out, although I would prefer to wait and purchase as opposed to rent. 

So, my goal plan is about eighteen to twenty-four more months of saving before I begin searching for a home.

I have definitely been slacking in terms of going to the bank, and all of my savings are currently sitting in an old student checking account I have. I am wondering if I should move this money to a standard savings account or go with a high-yield savings account like So-Fi to help grow it for a future down payment, etc. 

My hesitations with this include: I don't know how safe online banks like So-Fi are and how would the liquidation process work in the event of a home purchase if all my money is in that account. 

Finally, I also would like to start saving for retirement, even if just a little, to get that started. My employer does not currently do a 401K match, so does that mean I should open a Roth?

So, my goal plan is about eighteen to twenty-four more months of saving before I begin searching for a home.

I have definitely been slacking in terms of going to the bank, and all of my savings are currently sitting in an old student checking account I have. I am wondering if I should move this money to a standard savings account or go with a high-yield savings account like So-Fi to help grow it for a future down payment, etc. 

My hesitations with this include: I don't know how safe online banks like So-Fi are and how would the liquidation process work in the event of a home purchase if all my money is in that account. 

Finally, I also would like to start saving for retirement, even if just a little, to get that started. My employer does not currently do a 401K match, so does that mean I should open a Roth? 

Thank you in advance, and I am sorry for so many questions. I am trying to figure this out on my own and appreciate any advice you have."

3636,"23, currently reside in the US,. Desire to eventually move and retire in Japan. How do I start investing and planning for retirement? I want to start growing my money now.","I am new to Reddit and very new to investing. I've learned some basic things about Roth IRAs, Index Funds, and Bonds, but I still don't have any confidence in how they truly work and how I can start investing, especially since I want to eventually live and retire in Japan.

I am 23, over $50-60k in savings/money market. At most I get $15-20 a month in interest. No investment or retirement accounts whatsoever. I live with my parents, no expenses, so my money is just sitting in my savings/money market account. I am half-Japanese, I have a US Passport and plan to get a Japanese one soon. I am employed at my family business and I don't file taxes myself, everything is handled by our family accountant so I have no knowledge about tax filing, either.

I plan to stay with my parents for as long as possible and ideally I'd like to move as soon as the family business is sold and my parents retire (no timeline for this, could be at least as long as 5-10 years from now). In the meantime I'd work on improving my Japanese and move when I'm confident in the language and hopefully at that time I'll have investments and a retirement plan. So:

1) Roth IRAs/Index Funds. I read somewhere that these get complicated or there is no point in starting a Roth IRA if you plan to move to Japan before retirement. Is this true? After looking up information on investing I have interest in Index Funds/possibly Bonds, for low risk investing over time, but is this something that can't be done if I want to eventually move to Japan? I imagine it'd be equally impossible to try to open retirement/investing accounts in Japan from the US without any solid plans on when I could live and start working there (+ I don't have my Japanese passport yet).

2) If investing/retirement is complicated due to my desire to move and retire in Japan and lack of a timeline for this, is there any way I can invest and take out money in the short-term? Are share certificates my only short-term safe option for growing money until I figure out how I can invest and move to Japan for retirement?  I don't need significant returns, I just want to be doing something rather than nothing until I'm sure I can open a Roth IRA and start Index Funds/Bonds/investing without running into tax complications when moving to Japan and trying to manage everything from there.

3652,New 529 Provision - what do you guys think?,"Hi everyone!

I think most of us are now aware of the new 529 provision where we can roll over up to $35,000 (up to the annual contribution max) into the beneficiary’s Roth IRA if the account is open for 15 years and the contribution was made at least 5 years prior to the rollover. 

With that being said, does it almost make more sense to open 3 different accounts - one for my daughter, one for my husband, and one for myself and ideally have about $35,000 in each one by the time she starts college. This seems like a great way to reduce risk of unused funds. If she doesn’t need any of the money, it’ll go to her Roth IRA, and the accounts for my husband and I would also go to our own IRAs. If she needs all the money for qualifying expenses, we can do a rollover from our own 529s to her account and use all $105,000 for college. Just seems like it reduces the risk of saving $100k+ in her account and her not needing it since all of that money can be rolled over penalty free.

I understand we can’t double contribute to an IRA per tax year, but I’d rather do this and minimize the risk of overfunding the 529.

Does this make sense? Am I missing anything? I don’t see any risk assuming my husband and I can just rollover the money to her in the future if she needs the money for college anyway.",FinancialPlanning,"New 529 Provision - what do you guys think? Hi everyone!

Have no debt so car and house paid off. Current budget for the month is 800 for utilities, hoa, insurance, food, entertainment etc. Emergency fund of 6 months is set as well. Which would leave roughly $2,900 left for the month to save or invest. 

I’ve gathered that rule of thumb is usually max out work retirement 401k/457b etc. Roth IRA, HSA, 529 and eventually taxable brokerage.

Part of me hates the fact I tie up my money and unable to touch until I retire if I make it till that age cause I almost died to stage 3 cancer 8 years ago but back of mind I know I have to do it if I want to have a nest egg to live out my years when I do make it to retirement.

Does maxing out 457b government plan make sense with no match and would Roth or pretax be better to max out? I am a bit behind with retirement investing due to paying off debt quickly which might of been dumb decision but enjoy the piece of mind owning everything out right.

I recently just opened a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA at fidelity. I've been reading a lot and want to take advantage of the backdoor Roth. However, I'm unsure about the best path to accomplish this and also keep investing for retirement. I was planning to initiate the rollover of the 6K limit to the Roth IRA all at once in one go, but what then? Do I keep contributing and investing inside the traditional IRA? Does that make sense to do is there risks or tax liabilities or rules around doing that after the rollover. Or do I keep investing in my brokerage and only use the traditional IRA to facilitate the rollover? I've also maxed out the match on my company 401(k)  and not sure if that makes more sense to just invest in that over the match.

3671,Is there a way to make a CC balance transfer 0% APR for 15 months worth it if I can pay it off at any point?,"So I want to use it for an auto loan. It’s $20k at 5.25% over 60 months. 

I have the money to pay this off right away if needed, but I may need the money in June to pay off loans that’ll be higher than 5% (but also there’s a chance that my high interest loans will be forgiven and I’ll only have loans at 3-5% remaining) 
- This money is sitting in a HYSA at 3.3%
- in my eyes I’m “only paying ~2% interest”for the auto loan cuz of this. 

So right now, I can do a balance transfer on one card with an $8k limit (it sucks cuz every other card I have is 15k+ so when I applied for it I was hoping for a higher amount to reduce utilization). 
- balance transfer is 3% and for 18 months. 

If I pay the lowest amount for the car loan the first year amount is like $900. If I take the balance transfer of let’s say $6k it’s $180. I would use this money to basically make the payments to reduce the overall interest I’d have to pay.

This is hopefully not a dumb question, but I’ve recently been accepted to veterinary school as a non-trad student  (28) and faced with borrowing a mountain of student loans for the next four years. I have a Roth but with very little contributions thus far. My question is - can I use my student loan allotment to max out my Roth for the next four years and would it even be worth it for the additional ~25000 or so in loans I’d have to pay back. Or should I wait until working after graduation to start making contributions? I figure i’ll be paying back these loans for the next foreseeable forever as it is, so at least i’d have the Roth working for me in the meantime? Thanks in advance.",FinancialPlanning,"Using student loans to max out Roth? Hi all,

3709,I didn’t realize how many parents still help out their adult children.,"
While you may be thinking ya no shit or yes welcome to generational wealth and privilege, when I graduated college I was stunned at the amount of friends and peers I had whose parents payed for their rent/a portion of their rent. And yes while many of these peers moved to NYC and Boston, I was shocked at these peers moving to luxury buildings, living without roommates, or just outright not even attempting to live below their means. 

I understand fully too if you are a parent and you have worked hard and want to give back to your children, by no means I totally understand that but at what point does financially helping and assisting your children hurt them per se. I feel like by the time you graduate it’s time to be supporting yourself on your own to the best you can or at least be taking steps to work towards supporting yourself on your own.

For example, I live in Boston which is the second most expensive city in America to live in. I live in an apartment with no air condition, three floor walk up, no laundry in unit, no dishwasher and a 40 minute commute to work by train .I live with a roommate, but our apartment is very large and we feel safe and it’s all we need is a 23-year-olds just starting out in their career, trying to save money and gain financial independence. I would have never even considered, asking my parents to pay for my rent. while I did graduate college with a job and no debt I only looked at apartments that were well within my means.

When I had graduated from college, I was stunned by how many of my friends and peers had their parents paying their rent. They were living luxury buildings, and in high rent districts for their respective cities. No one considered moving home or just out right not living in a city that was too expensive for what your salary was. I feel like so many parents still help out their children and enable them to never live below their means or learn budgeting and its not talked about.

Sorry this might be a bit long

I recently bought a used 2007 Honda accord and now I have to pay around 500 to replace the starter because it’s end has been reached. 

Originally the car was meant for me and my sister to share, with her using it more since I’m away at college and can’t bring a car since I’m a freshman. 

I also got a refund check from my university for my scholarship and I’m thinking I might buy another used car for me and give my sister the Accord. 

I’m not sure how to go about this cause I could just sell the Accord and get a slightly newer car. At the same time I want a car that I don’t have to share cause in the fall I’m taking my car to campus. I don’t want to just take the car from my sister and have her resort to Ubers with weirdos again.

3742,Need Help with Allocating my Money,"I have $121,000 in student loan debt and I am a co-signer to my wife’s student loan debt as well which is $54,000 for a total of $175,000. Both loans accrue at 5.375%. I have been aggressively paying down my loan over the last year by paying an additional $3,000 in principal per month. All-in we are paying $5,000 per month on both loans with the extra principal payment included in that payment. 

I have $210,000 in our checking account.

We still save an additional $1,500+ a month into taxable accounts on top of this. 

I was running numbers on a compound interest calculator today, and as it stands, if we continue investing $3500 a month into retirement accounts until 35 (8 years) we will have $726,000 in 401k and Roth accounts. This is assuming a 10% return non inflation adjusted. We are invested 100% in S&amp;P 500 ETFs, which have averaged 13% non inflation adjusted the last 10 years. 

We live in a low cost of living part of the country. We grew up here, have decent jobs and don’t plan to move. My thought is - would it be a viable financial plan to knock down contributions to just my company match at 35 and max Roth IRA, so we can allocate the rest of that money towards taxable investments, rental properties etc.? Contributing to company match and maxing Roth accounts alone still puts us at over $2,000 per month going to retirement accounts.

3785,Give me your thoughts on a huge financial decision,"I’m a 28 year old male making roughly $96K per year. Currently married with no children and no plans on having children in the future.

I have always wanted/ not had a performance car and I am head over heels in love with the C8 corvette. I want to get one within the next year or two because it’s been reported the ‘Corvette’ will become its own brand in 2025 and won’t have a two seater V8 anymore. Buying another type of performance vehicle is not a choice at this time due to preference and buying a used C8 is just as expensive as new at MSRP, which I’ve been able to find.

My current take home monthly pay is around $5600 after putting 7% toward 401K and including taxes.

My current monthly expenses are mortgage/ utilities of $800-850 (wife and I split the housing bills) student loans of 135 that last one more year, and 50 on car insurance for my daily driver that’s paid off. I’m putting 400 into my Roth every month and 1700 into liquid savings. Which leaves me with 2465 (I’m putting 2700 into savings now but would take this out for car payment). I usually spend about 500 or so per month at most on other things such as groceries entertainment etc.

My plan would be to save hard over this time period for the down payment. I currently have 10K in liquid savings and aim to have at minimum 30K in my savings account so I can put down 15-20K on a roughly $75K out the door corvette. Monthly payments would either be 1250 over 48 months or 1000 across 60 (I did factor in 4% apr as I have a credit score of ~800)

I’m fully aware that this isn’t the “smartest” decision but wanted to get thoughts on the level of how much I can afford this as I don’t spend my money often on other parts of my life and want to make sure I’ve thought this through before committing.

Ideally, I’d like to pull it out and use the money towards my tuition for college. I’m just curious if that is the correct decision. I am not educated about financial things related to retirement so any input is helpful. 

I was told my options were to move it to a Roth account (not sure what that is and I’m certain that I do not have one), leave it where it is with no penalty, or cash it out and face penalty of 10%, plus federal and state taxes. 

I spoke to the retirement company today, and they said they would withhold federal taxes, and the state that I live in has an “estimated” tax of 0% at this time. The 10% penalty would be due during tax season. 

What should I do? Do taxes and penalties make the cash out not worth it? What happens if I just leave it?

I am estimating that my home will be worth $145-150k when I sell it, and that amount will then go into whatever loan we get for the new place (which will be bigger and, likely more expensive). 

My bf and I are going to have an in-depth conversation about our finances, and I hope to speak with a financial advisor soon as well. We'll most likely draw up some kind of Cohabitation Agreement. However, I'm nervous about tax implications depending on how we proceed and the fact that I have more stake in our future home since I already have the loan on my current home which will go towards the new buy.

 My bf wants us both on the loan and the deed to the house, but I'm unsure if that's best for me financially (I obviously want to take his finances and opinions into account, but I also need to look out for my own finances in the event that things end badly).

Sorry for the long explanation, but I guess my main questions are:

3809,Continue to live with brother or move out?,"I'm at a crossroads and trying to decide if moving out on my own is a good idea again. Tl;Dr at bottom

Backstory: I (31m) have been living on my own since beginning of 2019. I lived in a 1 bed/bath duplex in a moderate cost of living city in CA. Rent was $1000/month and I was making $50k at the time. I lived in that duplex until October 2021 (rent was raised to $1100 at this point) and then moved into a 3 bed/2 bath house, just by myself. Rent was $1575. I lived there for 7 months and then decided to downsize and moved in with my brother, renting a room in his house in June 2022 (currently paying $600 + internet only. Him and my sister in law take care of all other bills). I'm still living with my brother, but I do miss living alone. When I first moved in with my brother, I was able to pay off my car loan and now own my car outright. 

Present: I've been living with him for 7 months now, and there are really no issues, but I do feel like besides my bedroom and the guest/ hall bathroom, I don't really have my own space. I did find a 1 bed/bath for $1200/month, which is considered a good deal and it's in a very active part of the downtown area in my city. I'm debating moving again (3rd time in 2 years). I work from home 80% of the time so I spend about 18-20 hours of my day in my bedroom since my work station is also in my bedroom. I don't use the living room at all and eat in the kitchen/dining area about once a week. 

As for debt, I have no big debt since I paid off my car loan last year (nothing wrong with it mechanically and it's less than 10 years old) and my income is now $70k. So if I move out, I'll be saving less money than I would living with my brother, but I'll still be saving money. I am on a phone plan with the same brother I live with and including the phone payment and plan, it's about $100/month. I have a few grand in savings, bit haven't been able to save the last few months due to holidays. I can easily save $1k+ a month now that the holidays are over (even if I move out). I'm also putting away an extra $600/month into a 457b retirement account on top of the mandatory deductions from my paycheck for retirement through my employer. 

I do prefer to live alone and I have no issues living alone since I've been on my own since 2019. My goal was to save to buy a house, but I am in no rush to buy one and can still save to eventually buy one. I'm also single and have no kids, and don't plan to make any major purchases soon. I would be moving our family dog to live with me as well since my parents are getting old and cannot take care of her as much (she's a bully and weighs about 70-80 lbs). 

This is longer than expected. I'm just trying to see if living alone again is a good idea or if I should stay with my brother. If I do continue to stay with my brother, I would only stay about another year max. If I forget anything or if you need more information, please let me know. 

Tl;Dr: currently living with my brother paying $700/month rent, but I essentially live out of my bedroom only. Looking to move to a 1 bed/bath apartment for $1200 a good idea? I will still be saving money either way and will have more space for me since I work from home as well.",FinancialPlanning,"Continue to live with brother or move out?

3810,Considering moving to a higher COL city at an initial loss but greater pay in 5 years. Is this a good idea?,"My boyfriend and I, both mid 30s, have a decision to make of who moves where. I feel like there are pros and cons for all available options and I'm not sure what is the best route to take.

Current situation: My boyfriend lives in Chicago and is in federal law enforcement. His current salary is $80k but he will work his way up to $140k in about five years. He cannot leave Chicago for another 4 years in this current role. I live in a low cost of living city with total compensation of $160k a year. I am geographically limited on where I can work because I have a PhD in a niche field. The cost of living calculator shows Chicago is 30% more expensive than where I life. We want to be together.

CHICAGO OPTION: My boyfriend stays in his current job. He makes $80k a year this year and I take a job making $115k. Total compensation between us is $195k immediately. Based on salary ranges from the lab I'd be working for, I expect in 5 years I'd be making $130k and he'd make $140k. Total compensation is $270k. Downside is my career, giving up being a lead researcher to support staff since there's nothing in the area that's in my area of research.

LOWER COL OPTION: I stay at my current job at $160k a year. He takes a job at the local police department making $70k a year. Total compensation is $230k. In 5 years, I anticipate my total compensation would be around $175k a year, but his would be capped out at $70k. Total between us would be $245k. Downside is his income being capped out and he'd be working a crappy schedule for a while until he gained seniority.

3825,"Pay off student loans, max retirement accounts, or save for a house?","Basic Information

I am 22, turning 23 this spring. I have a bachelors degree and I'm currently working in the Aviation industry.

Income + Existing Contributions

I currently net about $3,300 per month, rounding to $1650 per paycheck. I currently contribute 5% to my Roth 401(k), as I do not get a match my first year of employment. Once I hit one year of service at the company, if I contribute 9% I get a 6% match which is what I plan on doing. I also have an existing Roth IRA, which is not funded yet.

Expenses

I currently live at home with my parents (rent-free) and I pay off my credit cards in full each month which amount to around $600-700 each month. My car is also paid off.

Debts

As previously stated, I don't carry any credit card debt, auto, or any other debt other than student loans.

Currently my student loans are as follows:

$32,220.12 @ 4.40% - Federal DoE Unsubsidized Loan

$63,661.64 @ 5.22% - Private Loan

The Federal Loan is not currently accruing interest nor are payments due, however, the private loan carries a minimum payment every month of around $730. I currently pay $2000 a month just to accelerate the payoff due to the large balance.

Savings and Emergency Fund

I currently have around $7,500 in a savings account as an emergency fund. I know this is relatively low but it can easily cover six months of my expenses.

Questions

What is the best course of action? I would like to be debt-free, but also fund my retirement accounts and possibly save for a house so I can move out of my parents house. I am very fortunate for the situation I am in, as my expenses are minimal. I know that tomorrow is not promised but my earning potential is astronomical, as I should be making 110K+ at the beginning of 2024. I just feel lost as to where I should put my money.

I'm a 19-year-old, full-time college student who is currently unemployed and has been for about the past 2 months, but my previous job paid approximately $21/hr, and the job I am currently looking for pays exactly that same amount. I anticipate to be in said job by March, if not earlier. That being said, here has been my budget for the past 2 months I have been unemployed. 

I drive quite frequently to visit my boyfriend, who lives 30 miles away from home. To split it evenly, I drive down to him about as much as he drives down to me. I spend about $25 on gas for myself a week. I also spend about $25 as a combo between eating out and occasional splurges on stuff I like (usually crystals, books, or board/videogames). I used to spend quite a bit more while I was employed, but I'm trying to cut it down, but still have a decent amount of comfort. As such, I spend about $50/week and $200/month on myself. I have about $8,000 left in both checking and savings combined, $2,000 of which I have in a money market account. So far, those in my personal life whom I've asked say I'm doing amazingly, but they don't exactly have the greatest track record when it comes to good finances.

1m purchase price, 750k mortgage.

4.625% 10/6ARM no points, locked at the moment. But if we pay $20000 we buy it down to 3.75% on a 30y fixed. We're able to do this since we paid a locking fee. Option I'm not considering : 4.825% 0 points 30y fixed. 

The breakeven from the monthly savings if we pay the points is at about month 52 into the payments. 

We have 70k in emergency savings after moving in and this 20k was earmarked for a new vehicle which we'll skip at this time for another year or so till we save up again, if we end up buying points. Possibly a baby on the way too so there's the day care money. HCOL area. 

Options I'm mulling through 
1. Borrow 20k less but that only reduces the monthly payment by about $100. Also need to stay in the Jumbo loan category. 
2. Borrow at 4.625% and use the 20k towards the principle and recast the mortgage once we figure out a few things in the new home.

3871,How to get our money back from bank?,"Need advice on next steps! Bank essentially stole our money. I mean probably not really, but we need it back and they won’t give it back. 

Here’s the rundown: 
- Fiancé and I both have individual savings accounts with Marcus by Goldman Sachs. We created a joint high yield savings account with BrioDirect, a division of Webster Bank with the goal of consolidating our savings. Attempted to transfer $ from Marcus to Brio using Brio’s platform on 12/2/22.
- Brio locked and then subsequently closed our account. The reason is still unclear, but that’s not actually the problem 
- My money returned to my Marcus account immediately. My fiancé has over $8,000 that was never returned to his Marcus account. It’s been over a month. We’ve been calling and calling- talking to representatives and supervisors from both banks
- Marcus consistently gives us the same answer. They’re very sorry but because a) transfer was initiated on Brios end b) accounts weren’t actually linked on Marcus’ end and c) there isn’t an account anymore at Brio, there’s not a whole lot they can do. They’ve been very kind and have even spoken to Brio’s supervisors in a 3 way call to try to get answers. No luck. 
- Brio representatives and supervisors have given me different answers every single time we have called. I have followed each and every piece of advice, I have waited the periods of time they have told me to wait, I have jumped through every hoop. None of it has worked and they truly have no idea. They’ve also been quite rude and condescending. 
- Today a Brio supervisor told me so many conflicting pieces of information in the same phone call: the money entered into the account and days later it was locked and then closed, the money never made it into the account because the account was closed and automatically bounced back to Marcus so it was their problem, and appallingly enough he had “no idea” where our money was or if it was at the institution. He also told me that there was nobody else I could talk to and in different words essentially I was shit out of luck. I was also told our account was closed due to insufficient funds (ie they never accepted the money), and that he couldn’t disclose why the account was closed. Previously I had been told fraud concerns. We may never know. 
- the latest info is that Brio has sent Marcus correspondence asking them to confirm that the account is open and valid. One person gave me fax info saying Brio faxed Marcus- Marcus says they don’t do faxing for bank account confirmations, they only do it over the phone. Brio says they only do fax. One lady said that if Brio doesn’t hear from Marcus the money will automatically go back to Marcus within 30 days. I told her it had been over 30 days and she said “oh well it could be 60”. She’s the first to relay that but of info so honestly I don’t exactly believe it. 

The total lack of any and all communication from Brio is appalling, as is the total lack of basic banking knowledge from their employees.

I have filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Any other ideas on what to do to get this $8,000 back??? This is a very significant amount of money for us!

They’ve been very kind and have even spoken to Brio’s supervisors in a 3 way call to try to get answers. No luck. 
- Brio representatives and supervisors have given me different answers every single time we have called. I have followed each and every piece of advice, I have waited the periods of time they have told me to wait, I have jumped through every hoop. None of it has worked and they truly have no idea. They’ve also been quite rude and condescending. 
- Today a Brio supervisor told me so many conflicting pieces of information in the same phone call: the money entered into the account and days later it was locked and then closed, the money never made it into the account because the account was closed and automatically bounced back to Marcus so it was their problem, and appallingly enough he had “no idea” where our money was or if it was at the institution. He also told me that there was nobody else I could talk to and in different words essentially I was shit out of luck. I was also told our account was closed due to insufficient funds (ie they never accepted the money), and that he couldn’t disclose why the account was closed. Previously I had been told fraud concerns. We may never know. 
- the latest info is that Brio has sent Marcus correspondence asking them to confirm that the account is open and valid. One person gave me fax info saying Brio faxed Marcus- Marcus says they don’t do faxing for bank account confirmations, they only do it over the phone. Brio says they only do fax. One lady said that if Brio doesn’t hear from Marcus the money will automatically go back to Marcus within 30 days. I told her it had been over 30 days and she said “oh well it could be 60”. She’s the first to relay that but of info so honestly I don’t exactly believe it. 

The total lack of any and all communication from Brio is appalling, as is the total lack of basic banking knowledge from their employees.

I have filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Any other ideas on what to do to get this $8,000 back??? This is a very significant amount of money for us! Any advice???"

I recently rolled over my previous employers ESOP balance into a traditional rollover IRA at Vanguard. I am just curious as to if it’s better to keep contributing to that for the future, or just keep that open and start a Roth IRA and start putting money into that instead. 

If not, is it possible to transfer the funds in my traditional IRA to a Roth? Is that worth doing?

Thanks for any and all help.",FinancialPlanning,"Put money into rollover traditional IRA or start a Roth IRA? Hi everyone,

3874,Starting my career and I need advice,"I am newly graduated engineer making almost $72,000 in Florida. I currently have about $11,500 saved (aiming for $3k/month) in a couple HYSA after working for 6 months. My main goal at the moment is to buy (save for) a house and am saving as much as I can as I still live with my parents. 

At the same time, I am not making any contributions to a 401k (i don’t believe) and I do not have a Roth IRA set up. I luckily do not have any monthly payments, but I have been struggling with my car. I have spent about $4,000 in the last 5 months on repairs to my car - granted I do not currently make any payments on it. Unfortunately there is a bit of uncertainty sometimes on if my car will start but I will say she’s reliable about 90 percent of the time (ECU issue). She’s got 130k miles on her and I expect her to push 250k as I maintain her as best I can.

At 24, I’m dying to move out to start my life but I am really prioritizing being financially comfortable for when that moment comes. I also have been thinking more and more about financing a car, but that would delay moving out for a terribly long time especially for how comfortable I want to be when I do move out (unrealistic?). 

My question is how should I really be allocating my money and what should my main goal be right now: a house or car for practicality?

3885,To save or not to save?,"Hi! My question is simply-to save or not to save?
It seems simple, or so I thought.
For context, I do not live in the USA. I live in EU, where my medical insurance and pension are covered in full by the state (provided i stay employed). 
I earn cca 1.300 EUR net/month, which is very average in my country, but in reality doesnt leave much wiggle room (just for context, an average one bedroom apt rent is 700eur).
However, I was lucky enough to not have to worry about housing or car, got it gifted to me, so have very little monthly expenses (cca 200eur).
I am single with a small dog. I dont plan on having kids.

Up until now I was saving rigirously. I managed to save up almost 20.000 in the last 5 years (mind you, my income used to be a lot smaller, I got promoted 3months ago).
I was always the ‘safe’ type so i tried saving as much as possible.
I understand I need to have some savings to cover unpredictable expenses and I CAN save some money, I dont NEED all that much.
However, lately I have been thinking about whats the point and what rly matters.

If I continue saving I might, best case scenario, have cca 150.000 EUR in my avcount by the time im 50YO. That is not enough to retire (I absolutely hate working), not enough to buy real estate (prices for a decent flat start at around 500.000 here), not rly enough for anything. Yes I could invest I know, but I am just not savy in that area and Im not a risk taker, so that is not going to happen.

I thought I will be married and we will buy our own place by now, but since I have hit 30, am an overweight introvert and I dont rly like people all that much that seems less and less likely to happen. 

Meanwhile, time flies by. Im living on a relatively tight budget, whereas if I wouldnt be saving regularly ( just occasionally) I could go on some rly great vacation every year. I could buy some nice clothes. I could travel and have more experiences, maybe I woudl actually meet new people. I could go to that dance class that I have been thinking about for the last 3 years. I could live the best life possible.

I am not the healthiest, dont have good family history, battle with depression and already find little enjoyment in life. I always felt like i wouldnt live to be past 60 amyway (all my grandaprents went from cancer before60).

Again, I am not talking living payckech to paycheck or getting into debt, I will always have at least those 20.000 to fall back on, i dont have many expenses and as said we have free healthcare and dont rly have tornadoes floods etc. i am also fortunate enough to have a well off family (in case of a life or death emergency) so i dont think i will every rly need more.

So, I'm in quite a bit of credit card debt and have no savings. I make a good salary ($3k per month after taxes) and I have about $1000 after expenses, so it's not as though I'm unable to pay off debt or save. But I just can't motivate myself to. I have a budget all figured out, but in the moment, I just really want that Taco Bell, I really want that pretty journal I don't need, I really want X, Y and Z. I can sit down and think, you know, ""I want to save to visit my family in France, I want to save for a car, I want to pay off my debt so I don't have to make these damn payments while I'm (hopefully) pursuing my PhD next year,"" etc. etc., but it all goes out the window in the moment, when that shiny thing is sitting there.

For those of you who experience the urge to buy but don't act on it--what do you do? How do you manage that? Do you distract yourself, or remind yourself of your goals? Or maybe it's a holistic thing, where I just need to fill my life with more time with friends and activities and such so I'm not sitting on my computer looking at Amazon? Haha.

So, I'm in quite a bit of credit card debt and have no savings. I make a good salary ($3k per month after taxes) and I have about $1000 after expenses, so it's not as though I'm unable to pay off debt or save. But I just can't motivate myself to. I have a budget all figured out, but in the moment, I just really want that Taco Bell, I really want that pretty journal I don't need, I really want X, Y and Z. I can sit down and think, you know, ""I want to save to visit my family in France, I want to save for a car, I want to pay off my debt so I don't have to make these damn payments while I'm (hopefully) pursuing my PhD next year,"" etc. etc., but it all goes out the window in the moment, when that shiny thing is sitting there.

For those of you who experience the urge to buy but don't act on it--what do you do? How do you manage that? Do you distract yourself, or remind yourself of your goals? Or maybe it's a holistic thing, where I just need to fill my life with more time with friends and activities and such so I'm not sitting on my computer looking at Amazon? Haha. Let me know your tactics!

By the way--I have ADHD. Not sure if that might be a contributing factor!"

3905,A question on transferring old 401k accounts into one that's more visible that I plan to use.,"Hello. I'm not sure if this is the place to be asking this, but I'll ask anyway. What do I have to lose right? Just wanting some other opinions. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, I have several old 401k accounts from jobs when I was younger. There are three total. My current job also has a 401k that I'm contributing to. However, I don't like the withdraw rules (etc) on this current 401k with my employer. I contribute to it because they match each contribution up to a certain %, which seems like a pretty good deal. The withdraw rules I'm talking about are basically when you're allowed to pull funds. It's basically once you no longer work for the company, or in some other rare cases. If I needed money for medical expenses, that wouldn't be covered.  

&amp;nbsp;

So, I'm thinking that I should take the three old accounts and open a new 401k with my main bank. That way one it's all consolidated in one place (other than the active one with my current employer), two I can easily see the balance, three I can contribute to it easily if I choose to, four I'm assuming the rules on with draws will be more relaxed for emergencies. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'll add, I shouldn't need to withdraw from any of them unless something drastic happens. I have over 120k in liquid assets. So I think (think being the key work) I'm doing alright.",FinancialPlanning,"A question on transferring old 401k accounts into one that's more visible that I plan to use. Hello.

We had a merger at work, and we ended up getting a new 401k plan and I'm just reviewing the options. The target date funds for the date I would be selecting have expense ratios as high as 0.37%, which seems a bit high for just adjusting a percent or so of stock allocation to bond allocation every year or so. In comparison, the total US bond market fund's expense ratio would be 0.025% and the total US stock market fund's would be 0.015%.

Is it really that high of an expense ratio just to let them adjust allocations instead of doing it myself or just setting a set 60% stock/40% bonds and just letting it sit?",FinancialPlanning,"Do target date funds add value in other ways besides the glide paths of asset allocations?

3919,cc debt and parents who keep needing my help,"hiya. bit of a read but bear with me please. 

i'm still living at home with my family and am really really hoping to move out at the very least sometime this year. the biggest hangup of mine rn is my $2700 of cc debt that i racked up over the last two years. i started smart in March 2021 with a secured card but i got too comfortable and now i have three cards that are maxed. I've never missed a minimum payment at least so if i can get out of this debt i will be in very good shape. 

hours are rough at work rn sadly but a typical month of income for me is around $1600-1800. i have zero obligations and theoretically i could just not spend a good chunk of money over a couple months and boom it would be taken care of and i can lock those pesky things away and never touch them unless i absolutely need them. 

the biggest issue is that i can't commit to payments that are like a good chunk of my checks cause my parents always end up needing help with something. but by the time they need help i will have been empty and then i end up using my credit card to help them and the cycle just keeps going like that. they're not horribly poor they get paid fairly well now, they just unfortunately had 5 kids in their 20s they couldn't afford and the consequences are still haunting them to this day. 

i don't mind helping them cause they do let me live w them rent free and have let me be very irresponsible these past few years but it's getting to be so draining emotionally. i'm not that person anymore and i'm ready to buckle down and start my life but i don't know how to break out of this.",FinancialPlanning,"cc debt and parents who keep needing my help hiya. bit of a read but bear with me please.

The weirdest thing though, is that after the shell shock from hiss anger and everything that happened, I woke up this morning and I feel almost... relieved?

So I recently graduated college and immediately found a job as a teacher making 61,000. Im in NYC so taxes are a pain but my take home is about $1,400 every two weeks. That is also after deductions into my Tax Deferred Annuity (TDA) which is a guaranteed 7% fixed return that is backed by the city and state. Many teachers have been known to retire with well over a million dollars because they contributed to the TDA. There are drawbacks to the TDA like you can't take out money until you're 59 but a good thing is that you can always borrow against your balance in case you need to buy a house or something like that.

Currently I am contributing $874 dollars per month into the TDA which helps lower my taxable income. The problem is that I don't want to retire when I am 59, that seems like an eternity away. I want to retire when I am 35-40.

July 2021 I purchased (financed...I know, I know) a luxury vehicle (BMW). It was a 2015 model with only 20k miles and was in great condition. I earned slightly upwards of 110K the last 2 years, intend on doing so for the next few, and my monthly payments/car expenses are within means.

**I've made questionable financial decisions in the last few years and so my savings only total $5k currently, but I can save around $2-2.5K a month comfortably now.**

The problem is, I commute way more than I calculated for work (NJ/NY/PA area) and I've managed to accrue 37k miles in only a year and a half (24k mi/yr avearge). I've been diligent on routine maintenance and between that and tire expenses (big rims + low profile + potholes = bubbles), I've spent about $8.1k in maintenance so far. I love the car and how it drives, but it was a **terrible** choice for a daily driver, especially for my high milage commuting.

I still owe $29.7k on the vehicle and trade in/sale estimates are around $18.5k for what it's worth. I want to sell/trade it for something that can keep up with my mileage (toyota/lexus) with decent options and milage, but the market for used cars is crazy and even a 4-5yr old Toyota Rav 4 can easily run close to $30K. The BMW is currently at 57K miles and I'll expect to be performing significant maintenance repairs this year based on my milage.

I don't have much money for a down payment, and my credit score is around 730. I would sacrifice a higher monthly payment for a 36-48month loan term (max 10% APR), if it meant I could have peace of mind knowing my Toyota wouldn't **also** cost me $3-5k in repairs in the next year.

3930,What should I go to a wealth advisor with?,"I have an idea of what I want my money to do. I have very little understanding of what money/investments can do. I also don’t fully understand the rules (taxable vs non taxable income, etc)  
  
Can I just go to a wealth advisor and they’ll figure it out, or is it better to go in with a plan.   
  
If you’re curious, I just want my money to build wealth and then maintain. Which I’m sure is common, but my idea is just that I’d risk x% on the market, take the gains and funnel back into the main amount. Or lose the money and take x% back out (unless it’s just not working).

3946,Would creating a monthly vs weekly budget be more effective?,"Hi everyone!

I’m trying to stick to a good budget so I can pay off some debt faster. I initially decided that I wanted to budget myself to spend $250 a week, including gas and groceries. However, it’s getting a lot harder than I thought because I’ll buy everything and not realize that I ran out of something like laundry detergent so thats another $20 spent. 

So I was wondering if I’m better off doing a monthly budget rather than trying to break down my weekly spending. For example, budgeting $400 to groceries a month, $50 to cleaning supplies (including laundry), $100 to activities, etc. On one hand, it makes it less stressful. On the other, putting a weekly budget makes me a lot more mindful of my spending throughout the week.

3948,How do I best consolidate my brokerage investments into a simplified 3 fund ETF portfolio at Fidelity?,"My individual brokerage is a mess of one-off stocks that I accumulated over the years. Most are not performing well and I want to simplify my portfolio.

I'm with Fidelity, so I believe the most simplest approach would be to utilize iShare ETFS in a basic 3 fund portfolio. From what I've read, Fidelity doesn't offer their own similar ETFs so iShare seems to be the way to go. I also believe ETFs in a taxable account are preferred over mutual funds, which I'd appreciate if someone could assure me that is accurate.

ETFS: ITOT, IXUS, and AGG.

Assuming I have the above correct, do I need to make this any more complicated than come Monday start selling off the current stocks (again mostly all drastically down) and then buying the 3 ETFs noted above? Is there a preferred method to doing something like this other then ""sell all old, buy all new""?

Since it's a taxable account I'm thinking the losses will be deductible come next tax season up to $3k (?) and then roll over until the losses are gone?

In addition to the above I plan to use SPAXX in my cash account to gain some additional interest for my uninvested cash.

I'm self taught and have done as much research as I can, but I also need some reassurances, so thank you for any feedback you can offer!",FinancialPlanning,"How do I best consolidate my brokerage investments into a simplified 3 fund ETF portfolio at Fidelity?

3964,How is a Roth IRA taxed?,"Hello,

So I am beginning my Roth journey with a new retirement account on SoFi. I have a couple questions.

1. Is contributing funds after receiving my paycheck the way to do it? At first glance it seems this results in being double taxed. Once when paid,and again when contributing. In other words, what’s the best way to contribute?

2. Considering this, is it more wise to find a way to fund through paycheck deductions. I know this has a huge effect on HSA contributions. (I already am matching my employer into a 403b but I don’t think Roth is offered)

3. When does taxation occur? Does this taxation occur during yearly taxes when reporting contributions?

4. Does it really matter who hosts the Roth IRA if there is zero commission fees. I would like to keep everything as streamlined as possible.

5. Lastly, is it wise to roll my regular IRA into my Roth to consolidate and maximize 2022 contributions?

She takes care of groceries for the kids.

My business cards run solid because at the moment i just brake even, they are charge cards. BUT i currently owe 2k that is going to get paid off at the end of the month.

I currently make 1,600 biweekly as a Food and beverage supervisor in Marriott, i got a security part time but i don’t start till end of next week. 

I want to pay some of this off so i can focus on my business that has paid handsomely in the past and i was in good health financially. 

(Not that it matters) but i handle stressful situations very well and this time i thought it was going to be a dip in my life and i didn’t realize until 3 days ago that i am very deep in this scary whole lol 

I literally pay my rent with a credit card connected to PayPal and i supplement my bank account sending money out of PayPal from a credit card to a friend and him sending it back so i have it as regular balance to then transfer it to my bank account. 


So, i owe around 62k overall

the credit cards debt was in about 7 months.

I payed everything for them to sadly move out the country and all my savings plus credit cards were used. 

Currently trying to get a 3 job i just have to start the second one and plan ahead with scheduling.",FinancialPlanning,"I don’t know if this is accepted here but I’ll still try. Im a 25yo with 23k in credit card debt. 

I have many responsibilities and people to look after for, im going though a nightmare divorce and was living in hotels for some months until one of my friends rented me a room in his apartment. I need to get rid of one of my cars and lower my credit card payments. I don’t want to close my American Express Business credit cards but all the other ones can go. What would be the smartest way to go about my current situation? Im genuinely under water at the moment. Than you and have a great day!

3994,Home buying and DTI ratio + Down payment advice,"Hey yall.

My fiancee and I want to start the home buying process in the next 6 months.

We live in Oregon and make a little under 90k a year before tax combined.

Our credit scores are 760 and 740, respectively.

We have 45k saved currently sitting in a money market at 3.3% return.

Our monthly debt payments are as follows:

Car loan 1 - 11k left, $280 a month. (4.8% rate)
Car loan 2 - 7k left, $220 a month (6.5% rate)

Credit card - $25 minimum (we don't pay the minimum but for dti's sake, it is $25)

Student loan combine - $50 (in forbearance)

We are looking at a soft cap of 280k and hard of 300k for house cost.

With the 45k, 5k will go to closing. I want to have at least 10k for savings.

This leaves us with 30k to put down. Our current credit union is offering 5.8% (6.04% apr).

I have a few questions.

First, should we refinance our cars to get the lowest payment possible? If we both refinanced for another 84 months, hers would be around $100 a month, and mine would be about $150. Making our total about $250. If we are to do this, how long does it take your credit score to bounce back up from the hard inquiry? We don't want it to impact our chances of a mortgage.

Second, should we put the entire 30k down? Or just the minimum 3%?

Third, do you think this price limit for a house considering our down payment and DTI, respectable?

I heard it's smarter to put the minimum 3% at closing and then the rest after the first few months. (This seems kinda off advice).
