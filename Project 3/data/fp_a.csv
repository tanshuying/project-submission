FinancialPlanning,"I’m self employed and saving my own federal taxes and trying to figure out how much to save since I tend to over save for taxes and could be investing that money. 

I’m a tax newb and don’t truly know how to calculate them so I’m doing a lot of estimating.


Pretax:

I make about 100k.

My wife makes 65k.

My wife puts 6% into her 401k with 3% match. Her part of the 401k contribution without match should be about 3900.

So that leaves about 61,100k. And she is w2 so her taxes are withheld. I’m going to probably assume they keep about 20% of it. So let’s call that 12,220 withheld.

I plan on maxing an HSA at about 7800. Then putting another 17,200 into a sep Ira. All my other investment accounts are post tax. That should total 25k in pre tax investment accounts for me.

Our total married filed jointly at this point is 136,100. The standard deduction this year is going to be 27,700.

So now our total taxable income should be about 108,400.

So estimating 20% of that is 21,680. Subtracting the estimated tax withheld from my wife’s pay (12,220) would make that 9,460.

I’m a tax newb and don’t truly know how to calculate them so I’m doing a lot of estimating with 20%. Last year we paid 9-10k to federal on 89-90k adjusted gross income if that helps. I claimed way more business expenses than I will this year but also I’m putting way more into pretax accounts this year.

FinancialPlanning,"tl; dr Do you really need to be retired, that is, not working, to withdraw money from a 401k or Roth IRA or do you just have to meet the age requirements? For instance, I’m considering whether I should invest in a Roth IRA after maxing out my 401k employer matching or contribute more to the 401k. One of the considerations is whether I think I’ll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Either I’m confused about the definition of what retirement is or this consideration is better stated as whether I’ll be in a higher tax bracket when I’m old enough and ready to withdraw some money. When I’m 60 years old I’ll probably still be working and getting paid more than ever but would like to buy a fancy car. In this case, the Roth IRA is an old-age account.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi, I'm having a hard time applying for HELOC for our house and our credit score is poor, therefore can't apply for any form of loans.

Last week when I was looking into a HELOC, that loan officer was knowledgeable and I never heard of a Home equity investment that the loan officer recommends.

I did do research on home equity investment. I think I get it, just need a bit more explanation and seems risky.

A HEI is for some people who has poor credit and didn't qualify for any loans. It's a 10-30 year term where that business invests in your home and give you $$ for how much your home value is at. You won't owe or pay anything back to that business until the term is over. So whenever your home appreciates, you won't owe as much, unsure about when a home value increases. That money they gave you must only be used for home improvements only and nothing else, when a home gets to the point of disrepair, they won't help you at all and when you're not able to pay the $$ back when the term has ended,they'll sell your house.

Salary is 80k. I currently add 400/mo to savings, also add more when possible (last month did an extra 500).

FinancialPlanning,"My wife and I are contemplating a new build 750k split-level home in a major metropolitan area with a 20-30 min commute into the city. We are looking at this specific area as we see value in the region and can start to see signs of gentrification and younger families moving in. 

My wife is coming to an age where it may not be safe for her to have children. I personally need to do more research in the women anatomy and learn more, but based on what she's telling me, we need to start moving. We're pretty career driven and expect our career earnings to continue to rise over the next X amount of years so being close to the city is important for her (I work remotely and don't mind being in the burbs in a dinky 3br house, but this is what she wants lol). 

We have a healthy nest egg between myself, her, and from her recently passed a mother and she's OK with us signing a postnup and her footing a major part of the bill so we can pay a sizeable down payment with lower monthly payments so should a baby arrive, we won't be tight on cashflow. 

Knowing that we're at 7% interest rates, does it make sense to take out a chunk of her late mother's fidelity account and put it into a future home? What are some of the calculations or trends I should be thinking of as she wants to sit down with her fidelity wealth manager to discuss? I haven't looked in depth into her mom's account as it was always a touchy subject and I never wanted to pressure how she should handle a tragic gift that she received from her mom. 

We both have pretty stable jobs each bringing home 6 figures, so should 1 of us need time off for a future child, we know we will be fine with a 1 income household. 

- Wife wants a house near the city, I'm indifferent but she wins about 90% of the time. Getting older so we gotta think about offspring.
- 3BR 2 BA ~750K townhouse 20-30 min from city
- 1M and change net worth, a large chunk in fidelity from her late mother. I don't know the details of this account, but imagine it's gone up and down during and post-covid.

FinancialPlanning,"Could use your help weighing options pertaining to a divorce settlement. 

Looking like I'm going to have to pay my ex-wife round about $100k. 

I will also eventually have to refinance the house so her name comes off the mortgage (10 years left on it, 2.5%) 

My options as I see them:

1. Transfer my Fidelity IRA valued at $69k + get a personal loan or HELOC. I'm not contributing to it anymore because of budget constraints, but even without contributing, it still makes money.

2. Refinance the house sooner rather than later. Lose my 2.5% interest rate, but do a cash-out option and essentially roll her divorce settlement into my mortgage payment. I could go for a much longer term and possibly have a similar payment as I have now.

It SEEMS like the better option is the cash-out refinance. But, I'm worried. Can you think of anything I'm not considering?

FinancialPlanning,"I currently drive a 2008 Honda Accord with 172k miles on it that is fully paid off. The bumper was held on by zip ties which recently broke, leading me to consider whether to repair the car or buy a new (used) car that would potentially be more dependable. 
The bumper and lining are blown, plus there is a small issue with one of my front headlights, so repairing my car would cost ~$3000. The car has no signs of mechanical failure and I recently replaced the AC, so I don’t foresee any issues in the near future. I just drove the car on a &gt;1,000 mile move with no issues. 
The alternate option would be getting a new car, probably something like a ~2017 Toyota or Honda with 70-90k miles for ~$14-16,000. I could put $10,000 down and pay the car off in 2 years with a very low ~200/month car payment. 
If I were to get a new car, my plan would be to drive it into the ground, so I hopefully wouldn’t have to worry much about depreciation. My issue is that I drive very little (~2,000 miles/year) so I don’t know if having a car payment is worth it when I have a car that works after putting in some money to fix it. Also there is a possibility that I could end up moving to a walkable city in the next few years, in which case I would be more concerned about depreciation on a newer vehicle.

FinancialPlanning,"Another post here got me thinking-
I dropped out of my Masters program about 2-3 yrs ago with 3 classes left due to multiple reasons (toxic living environment, depression, etc.). The credits are expired now and I doubt I'd be able to apply them to another degree, but I always planned on finishing (even if that means starting over) and potentially doing a 2nd masters + hope to pursue a PhD eventually.

I just started saving again for school ($500/paycheck 2x/ month) and am hoping to start sometime this year (June or August, early next year at latest). My employer reimburses 75% (100% if it's a ""required"" course .. i.e something computer or business related, though my boss is super helpful and lenient I don't think they'd 100% cover a full master's program so looking at 75-100% reimbursement depending on the class and what we can qualify it as) provided we obtain something like a B+ or higher..so I'm responsible for the upfront cost and don't get reimbursed until grades are out.

Currently, I have my savings in a high-yield savings account earning 3.75%. But am I better off parking it in a 529 (likely Fidelity)? But looking at their returns they don't seem to be earning much on interest (and may potentially have losses if I understood correctly) and I'm not sure if there will be issues with withdrawing in the short term.

FinancialPlanning,"Hey Everyone,

Posting here to get some thoughts on pursuing a new car purchase ($60,000). 

Im mid-20s, zero debt, and making mid-low $100s income. I save 10% to pretax 401k and 10% to post tax IRA every paycheck, and total savings just under $100k. I have a fully paid off car worth around $20k.

&amp;#x200B;

The housing market right now doesn't look great in a investment return sense, so I have been biding my time on investing in a first home. My philosophy is if I keep my rent expense under what interest/property tax would be on a house, and invest what would be going toward the mortgage, I am (at the moment) having better return. I think in the next 2-3 years (depending on rates and value appreciation) will be house buying timeframe. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is - would it be financially irresponsible to buy a nice car in this economy/stage of my life? I am a decently big car guy and run the math on a \~$60k new used ""sporty"" car. I have a yearly bonus incoming where I could use some of that as a down payment, and invest the rest. With trading in my current car \~$20k and 48mo terms I'm seeing \~$600 a month as a payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have anyone to consult about these types of things, and wondering if I might not be considering certain things / looking for alternate perspective rather than being rash and just pulling the trigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

How far might it set me back in a long term sense? Wondering if I might not be considering certain things in this decision, and don't really have anyone to consult about these types of decisions. I appreciate any insight or comments!",t2_yt8tk,0,I Want to Buy a Nice Car - Financially Irresponsible?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,11kcqfw,True,suckmybit,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11kcqfw/i_want_to_buy_a_nice_car_financially_irresponsible/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11kcqfw/i_want_to_buy_a_nice_car_financially_irresponsible/,546847,1678134120,0,,False,1678134135,1678134136,2023-03-06 20:22:00,,,,,,,

I was thinking of maybe taking the funds once they all add up $1000 and starting a 10 month CD, then adding to it when they roll over. I could split the funds again once there’s enough for each of them to have their own CD.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello all, I recently got a new job making about $72000 after tax and have been having a debate with my SO. Currently I’m 22 and have exactly zero dollars contributors to retirement. Going off this salary I could max out a Roth IRA at the beginning of every year for about 42 years. The company I work has a 401k plan where they match 100% up to 5%. Understandably if I don’t contribute to the 401k I’m not getting the “free money” but my thought was that my 401k could instead be used in “high risk” investments to potentially gain more than 10% return on my investment. I forgot the exact numbers but I believe maxing the Roth IRA with average returns created about $180000 of annual returns starting when I would retire. Overall I’m asking if this is a sound plan or if I’ve oversimplified a complex problem.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi folks,

I've managed to screw this one up by not being aware of the pro rated rule gotcha. First time doing this...  
Some background - a year or so ago I researched the back door Roth since I'm ineligible for a Roth contribution. My understanding at the time was that as long as I created a new IRA account and transferred the entire amount in that calendar year I wouldn't be subject to this.  I successfully did the transfer to the Roth account last year for both myself and my wife (I'm using wealthfront and it was relatively easy).

Now comes tax time and I did my taxes yesterday. In the process I came upon the pro rata rule and read through it again. I realized I had not taken into account that the rule applies to the aggregation of ALL IRA accounts you have. Unfortunately, when I did the back door transaction, I had not considered that I have another IRA account in a different institution that is a pre tax 401K rollover from a prior employer. Also, my wife had another pre tax IRA account that I had not considered. This now means that I have to either consider converting those IRA's as well or deal with the pro rata rule :(  


My understanding of how the pro rata rule is calculated:  
Taxable amount = \[total pre-tax dollars in all your traditional IRAs\] / \[total dollars in all your traditional IRAs\] \* \[converted amount\]   


Since my old 401K rollover IRA is a high value pre tax IRA (&gt; 200K) this is a big problem. I can't break that IRA since the tax ramifications would be huge. So, I started researching if I could reverse this back door Roth by recharacterizing it back to an IRA and then ran into this new rule:  


*""In the past, you could change your mind and recharacterize that Roth conversion back to a traditional IRA. However, the* [*Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)*](https://www.investopedia.com/taxes/trumps-tax-reform-plan-explained/) *of 2017 banned recharacterizing the account balance of a Roth conversion back to a traditional IRA.5""*  


In essence Roth IRA conversions are now irrevocable. What a minefield :(  
The big question is, what are my options here to recover from this mistake?

1. Do I just pay taxes on the back door Roth and live with this mistake?  
2. Is there another way to withdraw from the Roth and negate this transaction somehow?  
3. I have a new 401K with my employer and in theory I could move my roth to that but I'm not sure if they accept rollovers from other institutions. Even if it did I'm not sure if it would be a good idea and also it wouldn't apply to my wife's IRA.

It's clearly my fault for not fully understanding this, but man what a minefield!  
I'd appreciate any ideas on how to recover from this mess.

FinancialPlanning,"My wife and I are moving into a new home within the next 3 months, and I'm starting to get some butterflies in my stomach for a few reasons. 

1. I could have never imagined living in such a nice home considering how I grew up. This isn't a rag-to-riches story, but I grew up lower class and my family struggled financially for my entire childhood 

2. I'm associating the house I'm moving into with a New England price tag, which would have doubled or tripled the price of this home. My wife and I recently moved across the country and housing is significantly cheaper here than where we came from. 

3. The monthly mortgage payment is high, mostly inflated by the high-interest rate (7%). Nonetheless, the monthly mortgage amount 'feels' like a lot mentally, but logically, perhaps it's not. Details below. 

My wife and basically split all expenses 50/50. She works in the medical field and her job is rescission-proof. Im college educated, been with the company I work for 8 years and have a nice career path. Currently I’m on a director level, and the company is well positioned financially and in our market place to stomach a recession. 

High level personal financial details found below: 
We are able to save 21% of our net income in cash

We both contribute to 401k. I do 4% with a 4% match, wife does 3% with 3% match 

Our all in debt to income including the future mortgage is 31%

My wife and I do not need to earn a penny for 15 months and we can live off of our liquid savings account. The account balance would go to $0, but illustrates the cash reserves we have 

Considering her job is recession proof, I personally wouldn’t need to earn a penny for 25 months and we can live off of her salary + the money in the bank. Again, that means our account would go to $0, but it’s an extreme example and also doesn’t include lifestyle changes. We could go beyond 15 and 25 months if we were more conservative 

We do not foresee our expenses changing much over the next 5-10 years. We have kids, and we are allocating money to towards their future. The 21% cash savings mentioned above is after we’ve already tucked some money away for them. 

I do realize we should or could make adjustments to our 401k, and instead of saving 21% of our income we could invest more. But high level - does the above sound like my wife and I are doing well?

FinancialPlanning,"Please excuse my financial illiteracy as I don’t know as much as I probably should when it comes to my personal finances.

I’m a 20 year old student in Canada. I went through some troubling times with my car, housing and other expenses, and managed to amass about $5500 of credit card debt, split among 2 cards, with $1000 on one and $4500 on the other. 

I went a long period not being able to make payments and the $4500 debt (formally $7500, I paid off $3000) was sent to collections. Since being sent I have made that $3000 payment and made an arrangement to pay $500 a month until it’s paid off. My other card has been sitting at $1000 for about 2 months now and I haven’t been able to make any payments onto it.

I don’t work much and make only about $1000 a month, as I can only work weekends at my job. 

Would it be a better idea to take a loan from my bank to pay that off and then just pay the one amount every month, or should I continue to just buckle down and put ~$700 of my monthly income towards my cards?

I don’t know much about my interest rates and what not, unfortunately.

FinancialPlanning,"I know I might get a lot of hate for this, but some genuine advice would be truly appreciated. (All numbers below are CAD, not USD).

I am 23 years old and I take home around $4,500  a month from my job after taxes. I have $120,000 saved up at the moment, and I have very little expenses as I live with my parents and don’t plant to move out for a few more years. I save roughly $3,500 a month on top of what I already have saved up. I’m looking at a 2017 Z06 that is priced quite alright in this crazy market. So here’s the scenario I have in mind:

-Put $60,000 down, finance the remaining amount which is $48,000 (and leave the other $60,000 saved up for rainy days) 
-Monthly payment will be $880
-Insurance will be $350 (I currently pay $300 so it’s only going up $50)
-Gas will be $500/month (I pay $300 a month right now so I’ll only be paying $200 extra)
-Total car expenses will be around $1800 a month, so I will be able to save $1700 a month plus what I already have in savings 

I’ve dreamed about owning this car for the last 5 years and it has been my motivation to improve myself as a man and become the best version of my self. I made many sacrifices. I never partied, dated, went out, smoked, drank, or went on vacation. All I did was work and save save save throughout my highschool and university years. My job is pretty secure and I’ve been working there for 2 years now since I graduated university. Ever since I saw this Z06 for sale last week I can’t sleep, drink or eat without constantly thinking about it. It’s the exact spec I want, and it’s low mileage (only 10,000kms which is roughly 5,000miles).

I know this is not the smartest move financially. But I will never be 23 with a Z06 again, and I may not even live past 30. I have no gf/wife or kids and don’t plan to for the next 10 years, so this decision is a lot easier to make right now as I have no real responsibilities. Also,I will have $60k in savings plus save $1700 a month incase things go wrong. Worst case: in 4-5 years I’ll be 27 with a paid off Z06 and around $100,000 in savings. What do you guys think?

FinancialPlanning,"My husband and I (late 20s) accumulated a lot of debt from graduate school. We were basically living off of credit cards back then (very dumb choice), and now we’re very aggressively paying them off. It’s necessary, but sucks a lot. Through this process, we realized our financial habits are not great in general. We both work FT, but I have a lot of free time with my job. I end work at 2:30pm and I’m completely off over the summers (but I get paid). Our budget is tight, we have almost no “guilt free” spending money, and very little savings. In a nutshell, life is tough until we bulk up our savings and pay off the debt. I was reading online about women who have saved a lot working a side hustle. I thought, I’m still young, why not. I picked up a side gig at a bar for some weekends and over the summer. Cash, plus tips, and under the table. I was thinking of using this as our “guilt free” money and I can hopefully save most of my paycheck. I don’t know if this is a bad idea or not. Hubs thinks it’s a great idea (of course he does, lol). My friends think I’m going to burn out. Now I’m having second thoughts? I’m just so restless and everything is so expensive now. I’m tired of budgeting everything and feeling guilty about $$. Also, I feel like if I just sit around, I’m going to get bored &amp; to find a way to spend money. Has anybody had success with a side hustle? TIA!

FinancialPlanning,"I’m considering changing the due date of every bill to the 1st of the month.

Currently, things are due all month long. A few items are in automatic draft, but the majority I pay by directly visiting the website of the company. 

Some things take days to clear the bank, if I can’t use a debit card. (Examples: mortgage, car payment, etc.)

I feel like all I do, all month long, is…
1) Pay a bill
2) Wait a few days for it to clear the bank
3) Pay another bill
4) Wait a few days for it to clear the bank
Lather, rinse, repeat. 🧼 

Here’s my thoughts:
-4 paychecks per month
-Divide total bills by 4
-Transfer that amount to an account specifically devoted to bills 
-Pay all bills on the 1st

Pros and Cons of this? 

I know it will make each bill a little extra for one billing cycle, but would balance out afterwards. I also know that some places won’t let me do the 1st, but they’ll let me be somewhat close. I know it takes self discipline to transfer it all each month, which will be fine.

FinancialPlanning,"I purchased my home about 9 years ago, had a standard 30-year mortgage, then did a refi \~2 years ago and locked in a 2.5% rate for a 15-year mortgage. I've realized that I'm now in a position financially to sell some stocks and just go ahead and pay off the remaining \~$155K left on my mortgage. After selling off some stock, I would still have my untouched 401(k), Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, ESPP holdings, and emergency fund.

I guess the question here is the value of money over time. Since I have a really good rate on my 15-year mortgage (2.5%), one could argue that my money would be ""better spent"" on investments (earning hopefully significantly more than 2.5% on the market) instead of throwing it all at my mortgage.

FinancialPlanning,"I have been going back and forth around whether or not we should be using CD's or a High Yield Savings account to start saving up for a home down payment.

To give some background, we have about $10,000 to put away right now, and we plan to put away an additional $1,000 monthly for the next 18 months (the current term of our lease).
I thought it would make the most sense to put the $10,000 into a mid-term CD, and then monthly invest the $1,000 into shorter term CDs while continually rolling them over to best line up for them to all mature at the end of the 18 months.

We are currently looking at Synchrony Bank as they seem to offer competitive options for both CDs and HYS. Their 14 month CD is currently at 5%, 6 months at 4.25%, and 3 months at 2.25%.
The HYS rate is currently 3.75% (but it can change at anytime).

This is money we will not need to access as we have a short term emergency fund saved up. What are your thoughts?

FinancialPlanning,"I never really knew much about investing early in life, and didn't have the funds AT ALL due to a messy divorce and all the financial drains that come with it. Fast forward to now: I'm am in my early 50s, I have about 25k in 401k thru my company (only was able to contribute about 5 years ago) and about 12k in my Roth IRA. I have another 2k in individual broker account.  Right now I have a good chunk of that $ in my Roth IRA invested in VUG, some in VOO and some in SCHD. I really like these 3 ETFs. The rest is in individual stocks, most losing 30% or more like everyone else's stocks, a couple holding ground and a couple that have made a little money. 

My individual brokerage is completely stocks, about $2k worth currently. 

We also have about 40k in an 11month, 5% CD. That is being held as a potential down payment on a house so investing that when the CD matures is not going to happen or the wife would stab me in my sleep.

I watch youtube about best ways to invest, but they are almost always focused on those in their 20s and buying stocks or ETFs for life and how it grow per decade. I don't know if that is what I should do, as I am hoping to retire in 15 years and that wont be a lot of time for my ETFs so really compound its earnings.   


Should I stick with VOO, VUG and SCHD and sell most of  my individual stocks and put that into these 3 ETFs? Are there other ETFs I should be considering? Or should I focus more on individual stocks?

Another option would be taking out a heloc. We owe about $80k on a house Zillow says is worth $300k+ and our mortgage payment is $1,100 a month.

FinancialPlanning,"Some context. My wife (33F) and I (31M) are relocating from Ohio to Minneapolis. We have a 1 year old. 

We’re torn between keeping our current home in Ohio and renting it out and then renting in Minneapolis. Or selling our current home and buying new in Minneapolis. 

Current home: 370k mortgage, would sell for 600k - interest rate 3%. Mortgage $2,750 a month - would rent for about $3,400/mo. 

A new home of same stature would be a $3,900/mo mortgage payment in Mpls. with current interest rates. We see homes for rent in the $3,300 range. 

I’m taking a new job in Minneapolis and feel that it would catapult my career where we may relocate again in 4-7 years for the next opportunity. So feels like we’d barely break even at that time frame on a new home. I did get a $40k net relocation bonus. 

Income is about $300k household. All of our family is in central Ohio and truly love our home in Ohio. We could see ourselves coming back here some day and I think it would be awesome to still have that cheap interest rate in a neighborhood that’s coveted.

FinancialPlanning,"Here is my situation. My spouse and I both have steady incomes and currently don’t have any issues paying our bills. We are both setting aside a portion of our paychecks into retirement funds and have been putting aside $500 every month into a high interest savings account intended for our only child’s college. Right now that account has about $20k and a separate college savings account has about $25k. (He will be starting college next year so this probably won’t be enough but is a good start.) Aside from these two college accounts and our retirement accounts, we have no other savings or investments. 

Here is the problem: Due to some unexpected, very expensive emergencies and some general mismanagement over the previous 2 years, we managed to accumulate around $32k in credit card debt. We also have around $25k in student debt (at an average of 3.4% interest).

I have rolled $18k of the credit card debit into accounts with 0% APR until 8/2024 and am aggressively cutting spending so that I can pay down the remaining $14k by 8/2023. I would then  plan to pay down the 0% interest cards before interest rates go up. So right now I have a plan in place to get all of the credit cards paid off in the next 18 months. 

Here is my question: Should I prioritize paying down the credit cards faster by diverting the $500 currently going into the college savings account? (This would move my timeline up by 3 months and would save me around $400 net interest) Should I take part or all of the $20k college savings that is sitting in the high interest savings account and use it immediately to wipe out a large chunk of my credit card debt? (This would save me approximately $800 in interest but would leave me with no savings until I can get that built back up.) Should I do something else?

Additional info: We will be filling out our first FASFA this October so I’m trying to take that into consideration as well. It feels really terrible to take that college savings and use it to pay off credit cards but maybe it would actually be better from a financial aid perspective not to have that additional $20k in savings to report?",t2_4ysm3rit,0,Should I pay off debt faster or put more in savings?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,11h9jlv,True,dystopicunicorn,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11h9jlv/should_i_pay_off_debt_faster_or_put_more_in/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11h9jlv/should_i_pay_off_debt_faster_or_put_more_in/,545041,1677866975,0,,False,1677866993,1677866994,2023-03-03 18:09:35,,,,,,,

My thinking was that I would go ahead and max out traditional IRA contributions for the year in place of the Roth contributions that were disallowed, but my accountant advised against this. He said that because of our income level, none of the traditional IRA contributions would be deductible so there's no real benefit because it would create complexities later when it's time to take distributions. Does this sound right, are there really no benefits and we'd be better off just putting the money in a taxable brokerage?

FinancialPlanning,"Hi so when i was 15 me and my dad went to our local bank to open a credit card in my name. I didn’t truly understand what the difference between both of them i just knew i can buy stuff and do online shopping. 

Alot of people including my teachers think a debit card might not be suitable for someone my age. Now that i know that a credit card could help me build my credit score i kind of regret having a debit card. 

Should i switch and if so how?

FinancialPlanning,"I wont bore you with the details of how ive found myself in this situation other than to say that I was jobless for quite a while, have a family to provide for and ive now since found a job. I am merely trying to see if a debt consolidation would make sense in my position, and ill try and be as detailed as possible regarding my financial situation. Ive recently paid off my other 2 credit cards for more than $6,000, which has felt good. My main goals are to lower my monthly payment so I have a little more breathing room over the next 12 months to re-establish a 6 month EF, as well as taper down my overall interest rate so those 15%'ers dont hurt as much. Appreciate any opinions/advice here!

So after all is said and done, $2,893 of my $ is going to bills, and the rest either is saved or goes towards child care for my two kids who I dont presently have custody of. Im looking to see if I just stay the course here, having 1500+ of my income a month going to these debts, or do I consolidate and try to get these down to the 750ish range?

He can’t actually do anything since it’s through our work, so we do it but he tells us what % to put where.  After he changed a few things right off the bat we have made no changes in over a year. 

He also does a backdoor roth for us every year, and we do $800 month ($400 per kid) into 529 too, but that just goes directly into some generic fund that’s he’s not actively managing. 

So $3600 a year for a back door Roth basically.   I have the accounts set up, so I’m thinking it can’t be too complicated to figure out myself..

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all, my rent this past year was 2875 and is currently increasing to 3095 if I renew another 12 month lease. I’m a travel nurse making about 150k/year, but I only work about 7 months out of the year. Due to bad financial decisions in the past, I currently only have 60k in total of all savings/investments. I have 30k in student loans and about 3k in credit card debt. Credit score is 685. 

I am feeling lost and hopeless and can’t figure out what to do in terms of my living situation. I have lived in socal the past 10 years. My friends are all here and my parents are only an hour flight away. But the rent has gone up in all of socal. Orange County, San Diego, and majority of LA have normalized 3k rents for a 1 bed/1bath. Studios are going for 2700-2800. I want to start saving for a down payment for a house as im so tired of renting, but I’ve been unable to save as much as I would like due to rent eating away at most of my income. 

I have had roommates in the past and now at 27 years old I really want to have that option as a last resort, if at all. But I don’t know what to do in terms of finding a more affordable place to live.

I visited Florida thinking I could move there as some areas are cheaper but I didn’t like it, I felt very alone and isolated not knowing anyone there. It actually wasn’t much cheaper than socal, and As a nurse, working in California has the highest pay and best conditions, so I feel staying in CA is the best option. 

I have been debating ending my lease, moving my stuff into storage, and renting airbnbs month to month as it’s more affordable. I have also considered moving out of state but again I would prefer staying in the west coast, close to CA where my roots are and where nursing conditions are the best.

FinancialPlanning,"We're in the process of selling our first home - We bought at the low end of the market in 2016, and the house has significant equity: We owe 112k on the home, have an offer at full asking for 259k. After fees, I anticipate having about 117k deposited into our bank account. Our new home we purchased w/o a down payment, as I picked up a 2nd income stream increasing our home income from 110k per yr to 158k per year. Our monthly budget, before the 3rd permanent income stream, had about 1.5k ""left over"" that we honestly just had fun with.

Our home payment is gone from 1100per mo to 2650.

We have about 63k in debt between cars, credit cards, and new home improvements. We're planning on paying off the CC's and new home improvements upon the sale, leaving about 32k in remaining debt on the cars. We do this, leaves \~77k left for the sale of the house, which is slightly more than the 20% down we'd like to have to refi when rates someday come down.

Looking at the budget w/ updated #s, we'll have \~$4200 ""extra"" income at the end of each month.

My wife would like to save enough from the sale of the home to put 20% down when interest rates come down (I have a VA loan, we can refi for minimal fees if rates drop at least .5%). Im leaning towards paying all the debt off, which would increase that ""extra"" to about 5.2k, and deliberating saving towards that goal (say, 3.5k per mo) which means in about 20mo, we'll have saved that 20%. But, that would bring us below our threshold for the refi, to about 54k in the bank.

Ideally too, we have about 3mo worth of an emergency fund (\~21k), and a $10k ""credit card"" account to use for sudden expenses.

FinancialPlanning,"I'm 21 and work full time as an audio engineer/mixing engineer in Orange County, California. I started truly full-time last year around April/May and made about $20,000. This year with the current projects/companies I work with I plan to make around $35,000, and receive 1099-MISCs for reporting my income.

I work primarily out of my home remotely, mixing tracks for a production team in Texas that I travel to every few months, as well as a few other traveled events (all travel/hotel covered by them). I also make some of that money hired by other churches/venues for mixing assistance, installs, engineering etc.

I also plan that this year I will get my Real Estate salesperson license and begin working assisting an already long-time licensed friend part time, supplementing that income.

At the end of 2021 I had converted about $30,000 from a DCP to a rollover IRA with the intention of converting that rollover IRA to my Roth IRA. At the time, I was in a much lower tax bracket (effective tax rate probably around 20-25%). 

Unfortunately, I forgot about those funds and never made the conversion. That money has just been sitting, un-invested, in the rollover IRA. Now, I am in a much higher tax bracket (effective tax rate probably around 30-35%).

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all, I (24M) just started working in late 2021 and am just now starting to learn about all the ways I can invest and grow my money.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all,
34 year old in Texas. I own a disaster restoration business. I make about 300-500k annually, and can net about 75% of my total revenue after expenses. On a solid year with a hurricane (very common in my area) I can pull in 2-5 million very easily and NET at least 50-60% 

I’ve only been in business for about 2 1/2 years. But I’ve worked in the industry for other restoration companies for many years. 

My current stats aren’t good. I have no retirement savings. I only have about 10k in a Roth IRA and that’s it. If I understand fire correctly, I’ll need to save up about 1-1.5 mil to withdrawal that 4% to live comfortably? 
If I was able to live frugally enough for the next 5-7 years and invest all of my earnings each year into a Solo 401k (66k) and another 200k in a taxable brokerage account would that be wise for me to do? 

I currently have about 200k sitting in my business account now (non operating account) that I could throw entirely into investments now. Would that be wise? My business has very low expenses. My overhead is less than 5k per month. I’d rather invest the money than have it sit in my business account. This 200k is after taxes by the way. 

If you were me, what would you do?

FinancialPlanning,"I will attempt to make this short…

I am in my early 20s and my wife and I recently purchased a 2,700 sq ft home at 380k 4.5% interest (rate locked) I was more so excited at the thought of buying a home as I was a poor kid growing up and was looking forward to owning a nice new home that I bought all on my own. Recently though, I have really started to mature in terms of how I viewed finances.

Our Joint net income is about $6,700 monthly. She owned a home in which we lived in that she bought prior to us meeting. We sold the home (possible mistake) and bought our new home(possible mistake numero dos). Mortgage is 2,066 a month we split all expenses associated with the home and then pay for our own vehicles and other ‘personal’ bills. After all is said and done (want to’s and have to’s budgeted out) I have $626 left over this is without me putting any money back for savings. I cut ALL subscriptions, went to cheaper phone plan, and cut back eating out to $150 month. Obviously I have made some poor decisions and I am beginning to think this house was my most recent one as I feel I have become house poor.

My debts consist of:

Credit C-$4,200__16.50% interest__ $104 minimum payment  
(I’ve cut the card up and assured myself I will not do that shit again) 

Vehicle- $13,300__6% interest__$319 min payment

My question is, what should I do? I am going to be getting a raise of about 350-400 monthly by March but I figured I would get my finances in check based off my current numbers as they are concrete. 

I figured I would build my savings to a few grand or at least maintain it there, then aggressively throw all extra money at my credit cards, then my vehicle until they are paid off. Just looking at the timeline though and it is extremely discouraging on how long it is going to take to pay those off. I get that it’s a process and all but I just fear that I’m late to the party with all the talk of a financial crisis on the horizon, the time it will take me to pay off my debt I fear of times getting tough or my cars engine violently exploding leading me to be a more sad young man lol. We have a joint emergency fund of 25k but it’s an awkward thing for me as I’d be too prideful to actually use that money on myself as the money came from the selling of the home she owned and we have talked about it but still being a poor kid money had always been a cringe conversation for me. I want to build up my personal savings to invest and potentially start a business of my own one day. But figured I should probably start with cleaning my own backyard and getting rid of all my debt first.

Husband receives some disability but is otherwise unable to work - tldr shit happened, needs a lawyer, lawyer quoted us 10k in 2020. Couldn't afford it then &amp; obviously can't now. He makes $800/month. Until this is resolved (very high likelihood it will work out in our favor, but first we need to afford the lawyer... and then wait for court process. Going to take a while.) Nobody to help us financially, family will not help.

I am self employed, independent contractor bringing in about $4200/ month after tax. ($5000 gross, but since we are living paycheck to paycheck I am unable to save a dime for quarterly payments thus making this whole situation worse every year) 

Currently studying for a cert to get a 2nd daytime job. (Independent contractor work will be evening only at this point)

I got really depressed over this situation and was barely working for months, so I'm about a month behind on bills. I am working normally again and starting to make some progress but still pretty behind. Most bills are late, can barely afford groceries. Have been considering filing for an OIC with the IRS, but cannot even make current quarterly payments so not sure if I qualify there. If I am not able to make payments this year, I seriously doubt I will be able to keep up with the monthly payments next year. But it's already the end of Feb and... no savings and still behind on bills.

I feel so ridiculous because despite everything we make decent money but the monthly payments were already bad and then I burned myself out and made it worse. SO. Where tf do I start?

FinancialPlanning,"# The Situation

* My wife is pregnant and we're looking to move to a bigger home where we could raise our kid. Our current home is in a bit of an ""up and coming"" neighborhood. I want to consider renting our house out, but I'm not sure if it would be right for us.
* Current neighborhood is not the greatest. A few changes recently have led to an increase in crime - including a few shootings. Part of me just wants to get out while I can. Part of me is afraid it won't sell because of that and part of me thinks it might rent easier.

# The numbers

* **Total household income:** $180k + \~$30k in bonuses and stocks (IDK if those count towards income for this)
* **Current mortgage:** 
   * $340,000 @ 3.25% (refinanced summer '21 to pay for plumbing repair)
      *  $330k remaining on principal
   * $2,172.99 payment
* Limited other debts: \~$500/mo in credit card/student loan debt.

If I punch ""the numbers"" into a mortgage calculator (NerdWallet), it tells me that even paying my current mortgage and other debts that I can ""afford""(at 36% DTI)  a second house at \~$450k. So that's assuming no renters.

# Questions

* Essentially... would I be crazy to give up my current mortgage at that rate?
   * I've had some people tell me that even just keeping it and banking the money at 3.25% is worth it.
* Would I be crazy to try to rent it out given the neighborhood?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I just need someone to tell me to just sell the F-ing house, but I worry I will spend the rest of my life thinking I should have kept it to rent it out as most everyone I know that seems financially comfortable has investment properties.

FinancialPlanning,"First, let me lay out the details here 

35F married with 1 teen child

We own: 

Condo
$265k value and I owe $150k (4.375% fixed) in my name only

10 acres of land
$350k (ish) value and we owe $185k (5.25% ARM) in both names

Totally owed $335k 
Unrealized value $615k 

Other debts $20k (2 auto loans and a CC) 

To be paid off with a debt snowball by Oct 2023

We are thinking about selling the land partially because there will be a HOA fee implemented soon, and we ultimately want land without an HOA or restrictions. (Bummer they added it 2 tears after we bought it) it’s not a huge amount, but it’s the principal of the HOA forming that we disagree with. 

If we sell the land this spring, we would have about $150k cash after closing costs. 

The question is, should we pay off some or all of our Condo mortgage, or should be put it in a mix of HYSA (4%) and buying index funds? Or could we do something even better? 

We plan to keep the Condo as a rental in the future, but want to stay here for the next 3 years to continue building a financial safety net. We DO NOT have any help or anyone to call in case of an ER. We are pretty risk averse bc of that. 

Pros to paying off Condo 
1. We would have about $1000 more to invest monthly bc we wouldn’t have a mortgage to pay. 
2. Saving money on long-term finance charges. 
3. No debt or financial obligation. The asset will be owned outright 

Cons of paying off the condo
1. Forfeiting the opportunity to put the money in the stock market or another investment property. 
2. Losing lowish interest rate - rates are like 3-4 pts above there right now. 

Initially we started thinking about this bc of the HOA fee on the land, but we don’t want to make a rash decision and feel like we missed out on money. 

Should we sell the land? Should we pay off the condo mortgage?

FinancialPlanning,"I am in an interesting situation. I recently left a US employer and relocated overseas to Norway. I have a Traditional 401k back in the states with a balance in the high five figures. I just spoke to a tax advisor who informed me that Norway does not recognize the tax advantages of US retirement accounts (whether 401k or IRA, Traditional or Roth). 

In short, if I keep the money where it is, Norway will treat it as a taxable investment account and tax me every year on dividends, interest, and distributed capital gains. Then if I take the money out in retirement, the US will want tax on the full withdrawal at that point and due to the timing difference it'll be difficult to credit the Norwegian taxes already paid.

The advisor's best suggestion was to find a tax efficient investment that reduces the taxable events, i.e. one that has very little in the way of interest, dividends, and distributed gains.

Any suggestion on good options besides dumping it all into Berkshire Hathaway (since Buffett has vowed never to pay a dividend)?

I am debating between maxing out my 401k or not. Pros of maxing out are obvious: more towards retirement and less taxable income. I also am maxing out HSA and IRA (will max those out regardless)

Cons are if I max out my 401K, then my monthly budget will be very tight. Not impossible but I would definitely have to make changes to my current lifestyle and focus on minimizing spending across the board.

Condo fee. (Includes gas and water)

Student loans (starting June)
Netflix and peacock (8$ total for both)
Apple storage (99 cents)
Apple iTunes (student price)
Internet

Other monthly spending: 
food (can def cut here)
Pet expenses (mostly food and treats)
Gas (about 50-75/mo)
Laundry (runs about 3$ for load and dry)
Spend/social (can cut here too)

FinancialPlanning,"My current smartphone is HUAWEI P30. It has Google support. I bought this phone on 2019, which was about 3 years ago. I have started to feel that this phone is outdated. It's been like a year since the last security updated has been enrolled for this phone. There's no more now.. All the built-in and third party apps still get updates on Play Store tho. It also doesn't get Android update anymore. It ended at Android 10. As we all know, the latest Android version is Android 13. This phone is still able to run PUBG Mobile at smooth+extreme(60 Hz) setting. But it does feel hot after like half and hour and the battery drains fast when I play the game mentioned. Other than that, it doesn't have lagging issue while running other essential apps like banking apps, note, Microsoft Office apps and so on.

My biggest concern here is the software update. This phone doesn't get security update anymore and the Android version is outdated. I've been thinking about buying a new phone. I have the money from my saving but I'm a bit stingy when it comes to spending money on something that I might not need. I'm thinking about buying the new Samsung Galaxy S23 plus. I read somewhere on the Internet that Samsung promised to give 5 years of security updates and 3 major updates of Android version for that model.

As a matter fact, I don't really use heavy apps. I also rarely play heavy game like the PUBG Mobile. I only play it when I have nothing to do. My hectic life as a university student is the reason why I don't really play game anymore. I use my phone mostly for social media like Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, WhatsApp and so on. I also don't really take pictures. The way I use smartphone makes me contemplate whether I should buy a new phone or not.

FinancialPlanning,"I am early 40s and I have a good 401K with my employer with reasonable ETF options.   I can get up to an 8% from my employer.

I started saving late (30), since I was in grad school making very minimal money.  I've been following the flowchart at trying to make smart decisions. Current salary is ~130K. I have ~270K in 401K and 30K in a Roth IRA. I keep reading that you should max out your IRA first, but I think that isn’t the best advise for my situation, and I’d like to get feedback in case I’m missing something. Given my tax bracket, I expect to make less in retirement, so I do not think continuing to contribute to my Roth IRA makes sense. Given my salary, and the fact that my company offers a 401K, I cannot defer taxes with the traditional IRA.    

I’m currently putting in 15% of my own (not including the 8% from the employer), but I’m about to pay off my car and would like to redo the budget and start maxing out retirement accounts.  I’m thinking I should max out the 401K first to get the tax deferment and lower my MAGI. After I max out my 401K, I could divert more pre-tax money to a traditional IRA.  Any difference between those investments for the remainder of the year, up to 6500, I could fill in with after-tax money to either the Roth or the Traditional (filling out Form 8606).  If I’m using after-tax money to max out the IRAs (I understand it’s 6500 across all IRAs combined), is there any benefit of the Roth or the Traditional IRA?

FinancialPlanning,"My wife has a private student loan that was set up for her by her step-dad. She didn't really understand what the loan meant when she agreed to it back in 2006. 

The loan has been sold off several times and each time it's sold, the interest rate increases. 

This loan is split into two segments:

Loan 1 - $8021.05 at a 10.250% rate
Loan 2 - $10708.34 at a 9.75% rate 

The last time I checked these loans (which are on autopay) was somewhere around low 6%'s. 

If I have this much in an investment account which, given the market volatility, is down 0.6% for the quarter, it would make way more sense to drop this money on these loans asap and rid ourselves of this crazy interest, yeah? 

This investment account isn't all our money, but it is enough of a portion that I'm concerned to lose it. Our other option is to switch it over to our high yield checking account which is 4.5% APY. 

The interest rate on these loans has only increased since I've tracked them. They started out at a 3% rate back in 2011. 

What's the preferred strategy here? Dump 'em off and build the investment account back up when the market is better? Move the money to our high yield account and increase the monthly payment to a manageable amount to decrease the impact of this crazy interest rate? Rob a bank?

FinancialPlanning,"So my cat is turning 9 soon and as he’s getting older I think it’s probably a good idea to get pet insurance. We’ve had a few scares the past few years (turned out to be fine) that racked up at least $500 in vet bills each time and if my cat had an actual real medical issue and not just a scare I imagine it would be much more expensive. Our vet recommended trupanion and from my research it seems like a solid choice. My question is should I do a higher deductible to make my payment lower or lower deductible with higher payment. You can customize the deductible anywhere from $0 a month to $1000. I could afford a $1000 emergency it would suck of course but I could afford it without an issue. I’m just not sure what amount would be the best and make the most sense.

FinancialPlanning,"**10 helpful and common strategies for paying off debt:**

1) Make a budget and stick to it: This will help you track your expenses and determine where you can cut back.

1a) Think of money as a tool, and use your money resourcefully to get rid of debt. Creating a budget will help you visualize where you can cut back spending and where you can apply that money to your debt.

1b) To get started, you can look at old credit card and debit card statements to get an idea of where your money is being spent on expenses, and then figure out areas in which you can cut back. Budgeting with software, websites, or apps can also make budgeting easy to stick with. Creating a budget can help you better track your money.

2) Consider consolidation: If you have multiple debts with different interest rates, consolidating them into one loan with a lower interest rate can save you money and make it easier to manage your payments.

3) Negotiate lower interest rates: If you have good credit, you may be able to negotiate lower interest rates on your loans, which can help you to pay them off faster.

4) Create a debt repayment plan: Prioritize your debts and create a plan to pay them off as quickly as possible.

5) Find ways to increase your income: Consider taking on a side hustle, negotiating a raise at work, or looking for a new job with a higher salary, to help you pay off your debts faster. 

5a) There are dozens of websites online that allow you to browse jobs from the comfort and convenience of your home. It does not hurt to browse jobs, and you may be able to secure a job that pays more.

5b) Additionally, due to technological advances, we are also living in a time where the “gig economy” is more popular than ever, and it has never been easier to pick up a “side hustle” to earn extra cash. Many apps and websites allow you to work on your time, and on your schedule. There are so many options such as dog walking, cleaning, tutoring, being a driver, simple home repairs and handyman work, delivering food, picking up groceries, and helping others move just to name a few.

6) Being frugal can help you pay down debt because by being frugal you are being more resourceful with your money. Being frugal is not the same as being cheap. Being frugal is prioritizing your spending so that you can focus on spending your hard-earned money on paying down debt.

6a) It is important to have an idea of how much you spend on wants vs. needs, such as entertainment or eating out. You need to Know the difference between needs and wants.

• Needs (food, shelter, utilities, basic clothing, healthcare, transportation)  
• Wants (Entertainment, Vacations, dining out, the newest tech &amp; electronics, new clothes/ designer clothes, luxury car payments, multiple streaming services).

7) An easy way to save and cut expenses, so that you can use that money to instead pay down debt, is to shop around for cheaper auto insurance or homeowners/ renters insurance. By just doing a quick comparison online, you can potentially save hundreds of dollars. Other insurance companies are interested in having you as a customer and tend to offer competitive rates.

8) Avoid taking on new debt: Avoid using credit cards or taking out loans unless it is absolutely necessary.

9) Use the Avalanche method to pay off high-interest debt first, you can save money in the long run by reducing the amount of interest you pay overall.

9a) Based on math, the debt avalanche method is the best strategy that uses money as a tool, because it will save you money due to paying less interest in the grand scheme of things. Mathematically, it makes sense to pay off debt first that charges a 21% interest rate, over debt that is only charging a 4% interest rate to borrow money.

10) Stay committed to the debt repayment plan and celebrate small victories along the way to stay motivated.

Two methods to pay off debt are the ""snowball"" &amp; ""avalanche"" methods, here are the basics:

Avalanche Method:

• Pay debts from highest to lowest interest rate regardless of balances.  
• Prioritizes high-interest debts to minimize interest paid.  
• Pros: More financially efficient, saves money on interest and helps pay off debts faster.  
• Cons: Could take longer to pay off smaller debts, which could discourage some. It may require higher monthly payments, which could be challenging for those with limited cash flow.

Snowball Method:

• Pay debts from smallest to largest balances regardless of interest rates.  
• Prioritizes momentum and motivation from quickly paying off smaller debts and helps tackle larger debts.  
• Pros: Boosts morale, builds momentum and motivation, increasing the likelihood of staying motivated. Smaller debts paid off quickly can provide a sense of achievement.  
• Cons: Not the most financially efficient method. It could take longer to pay off all debts and cost more interest over time.",t2_2w3c6vt1,0,10 helpful and common strategies for paying off debt:,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,11dh453,True,TonyLiberty,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11dh453/10_helpful_and_common_strategies_for_paying_off/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11dh453/10_helpful_and_common_strategies_for_paying_off/,542682,1677518126,0,,False,1677518138,1677518138,2023-02-27 17:15:26,,,,,,,

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all - I'm about to hit 2 years of ownership with my car that I purchased new.  I was able to snag 0% financing for 5 years and my payments are currently $470.  I owe about $17,800 with about 38 months left on the loan.  I believe I could likely sell the car and net ~$12k.

While this could change, I believe I can qualify for ~5.5% interest.  I'm looking at older CX-5s in the $16-$18k range which with a 3 year loan would put me in the $150-$180 per month range.  Barring anything catastrophic maintenance-wise, I don't see maintenance costing more than the $8k-$10k difference it would be to keep my current car and pay it off.

To give some context, the first floor has two bedrooms and the second floor has one bedroom. Everything is brand new including electrical panels, boiler, and etc. The property is going for 500K.

As mentioned in the title, my monthly mortgage payment would be 4K. I was planning to live in the one bedroom unit for a year and rent the two bedroom unit for about $2200. However, my family is highly advising against that because I only bring in $5,200 each month after taxes and other deductions. 

I know that the equity for this house would increase substantially and I’d only would need to pay $1800 out of pocket for the rest of the mortgage. Eventually, I’d like to rent out both units and refinance since current interest rates are high.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi…looking for some real estate advice and also financial advice I suppose since they are intertwined. I am going to try my best to describe our situation and hopefully someone can advise me as to how we can move forward. Thank you to anyone who can help! 

We are currently living with family and it is a true disaster. What was supposed to be 1-2 months has now turned into 8 months with no potential end in sight. My marriage has been torn apart, my children are suffering (one of them is talking about hurting himself due to this living arrangement) and I am close to suffering from a nervous breakdown per my own mental health and the vulnerable place my son is in. In other words - WE NEED TO GET OUT! 

We have enough $ saved up for the 3.5% down payment required for our FHA loan. We do NOT have the remaining amount of $ required for the closing costs. We live in a high COL area where the taxes are very high ($10k per year and higher) so it adds close to $1000/month for the taxes on to our mortgage payment per the calculations provided to us by our lender. So, if we were to use a $450k house as an example with $10k per year of taxes, we would be paying approximately $4000/month for the mortgage payment if we got the interest rate at 6.25%. It really comes out to $3,966/month but close enough. 

We have looked at houses that are under $450k and they are literally gut jobs. They are NOT even liveable. Especially not with 3 small children. We don’t have any $ other than the down payment, and we have now submitted 10 offers with asking for sellers closing assistance (2 of those offers we only asked for $5k in closing cost assistance) and they have ALL been rejected. 

No, our families cannot “gift us” any $ to use for the closing costs. They barely want us living with them. And have made it quite clear.

I have been trying to find a rental but I can’t seem to find anything for under $3000/month. And it is usually a 2 bedroom condo. We can’t all fit in it. We also have dogs, which makes the process even harder. But we can’t just get rid of the dogs- they are apart of the family and are very well behaved pets. We even wrote a letter with a picture of our family to include with the offers but I guess it didn’t matter because we got rejected anyway. 

Does anyone have any ideas of strategizing to obtain an accepted offer? If not, can anyone suggest an alternative to finding another place to live? 

Thank you so much for the help!

I’m afraid I have some challenge in understanding how everything works. I did not have a lawyer for my case but I have recently heard news that I am being approved SSI benefits and backpay for the time my case was being processed. 

I really rely on my current situation in order to maintain my simple life and health related issues. 

Because my disability was not diagnosed until after the age of 26, from what I understand I cannot open an Able account but can open an AbleNow? Is this a viable option to keep ssi and be able to purchase a van or alternate living in the future? What do I need to know about these that may effect my ability to move to a new state in a few years? 

Also are there any better alternatives?

FinancialPlanning,"Hello,

I recently spoke with a financial advisor who introduced Permanent Life Insurance to me. I have talked with other financial planners but have never heard of this. I am a 25-year-old business owner with a fiancee that I will marry next year. I have low debt but am still renting (I plan to buy in the next 18 months). I am also in the process of starting a sales/marketing company. Last year I brought home about $275,000 after paying my employees, and I plan on making between $350,000-$400,000 this year. We do plan on having kids or adopting at some point in our life. 

I do see there are benefits of the ""cash value"" where I can withdraw the money and never have to go to banks. Both my fiance and I grew up on the poorer end of things, so passing on wealth is highly important to me as well. But at the same time, I imagine I will have to help out my parents during their old age. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am torn between getting Permanent Life Insurance and just getting Term Life Insurance. I already invest a good portion of my money as well into the market. From what the financial advisor showed me, it would take 35-40 years to double my money with permanent life insurance, but I would have the death benefit, which I believe was 2.5-3 million. If I continue to invest in the market like I currently am, it will only take 8-11 years to double my money. To me, it seems like I should go with Term Life Insurance and just keep investing in the market. multi",t2_3r8izupc,0,Should I get Permanent Life Insurance as a business owner?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,11ckady,True,glambo300,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11ckady/should_i_get_permanent_life_insurance_as_a/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/11ckady/should_i_get_permanent_life_insurance_as_a/,541970,1677426236,0,,False,1677426252,1677426252,2023-02-26 15:43:56,,,,,,,

I was diagnosed with ADHD in 2020 after I suspected my family having some relatives that were diagnosed as well.

I  am struggling with making the decision to go back . The first issue is I  don't know if I'm committed to go, but a degree would be most likely  needed for me to succeed in securing a job in the career I'm interested  in. The major second issue, is that I'm in debt already from the loans I  had to take out (9,000 dollars)  and I have no desire of wanting to  rack up more debt.

I'm planning on going in IT. After getting some work experience, I can see myself in this field.

FinancialPlanning,"Im very fortunate in all aspects of my life - especially in my job security and income level, that I am able to safe meaningfully for retirement. I’m not a finance guy but between 401k’s target date fund, hsa investments, and VTI set and forget automatic transfers into my brokerage account - I feel confident in my savings strategy. But there is always that little voice at the back of my mind that whispers “what goes up, must come down”.

I must admit that all my financial security of the future, especially my retirement, is based on the assumed truth that the stock market will keep going up, that my savings will compound, and that, despite occasional dips, the market always recovers to higher levels than before. All retirement calculators that I have used are based on this truth.

Are there economic laws that prove this concept to be true? In my line of work (science/medicine) I’ve always found that anything to goes up, comes down eventually, or at least comes to an equilibrium.

But this year I want to add a new income stream and I'm at a loss for ideas.

Here are my stats:

\-I have 6 months of living expenses saved in a high-yield savings account as an emergency fund

\-a sizable investment portfolio in the stock market ($60k-ish depending on the day)

\-Roth IRA that I max out every year

\-TSP (government version on a 401k) @ 5% contribution

\-and a 781 credit score

\-I have access to the VA Loan, so having a huge savings account for a house downpayment is not a priority

&amp;#x200B;

$55K/yr salary + 60/hr playing live poker, ~750 hrs/yr. I have eclipsed $20,000 in savings for the first time since I was 24. I have a poker bankroll that is the almost the exact same size (cash and mostly chips) in a safety deposit box at the room I play at the most. $7K in checking acct.

Right before COVID hit, I had a huge bankroll from poker and lost it all within a year just spending and not working. I have no concerns about losing it all this time around, and my discipline and mental health is in an entirely different place, but I do have grave concerns that I could be smarter with my money. 

I have no equity. I don't own a car; my job is full time remote, and I spend about $600/mo on Uber/Lyft getting to and from the cardroom. I am renting an apartment with my girlfriend for which I pay half of; about $1200/mo out of my pocket in living costs - rent, utilities, groceries. I have to wait a couple more weeks as a drivers' license suspension from out of state expires. 

I feel like I have reached an amount of money where it's blatantly dumb to have it just sitting there. I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts about where to put $3k-$5k of this to generate even the smallest of ROI, or to make my savings work for me in any way possible? Please forgive my ignorance.

FinancialPlanning,"I’m looking for some advice.

I’m 35 years old and I know nothing about finance. I was raised by a single mother living paycheck-to-paycheck. (The extent of any financial teaching growing up was “keep the heat turned down” and “I’m sorry, we can’t afford it”.) I never heard an adult talk about retirement, investing, different types of savings etc.

Now I’m realizing that as an adult it is my responsibility to learn if I want my life to look different. And I know I’m a bit old, but better late than never feels pretty applicable.  I finally have a decent job. I don’t make a lot, but if I live frugally I can actually start saving for the first time.

But trying to learn is feeling really overwhelming and emotional.  I think it’s daunting to realize how much I don’t know.  I don’t understand what a stock is. I don’t know what a 401k is. I don’t know what a CD is. Even things I see for beginners seem to assume I know these things.

And I don’t even know who the right professional is to ask! Can I just walk into my credit union and ask questions relating to retirement savings? An accountant? A financial advisor? 

I’m not expecting you guys to teach me these things— what I’m wondering is just, in the vast overwhelming sea of information on the internet, where to start. Any good resources for beginners? (I genuinely don’t even care if they are designed for kids/teens.) What types of professionals generally provide basic guidance?  Or even: What is most important to learn about first?

FinancialPlanning,"My retirement pension plan is 2.5% at 67. They take the average of my 3 highest years of pay (which is 100k) and use that to calculate my yearly payout. I’m 32 years old and almost at the 5 year mark of employment and will be vested then.

The earliest I can receive my pension is 52yr old. Here is a break down of my pay out at certain ages.

52 = 5% of 100k 
62 = 9.5% of 100k
67 = 12.5% of 100k

So if I wait till I’m 67 years old I’ll get 12.5k a year till I die but only 5k if I choose to start receiving it at 52. It has a COLA adjustment once I start receiving it every year too.

FinancialPlanning,"12 years ago my partner and i were in a position to purchase a home and pay it off. We paid 350k for a livable fixer-upper, and as modest earners, have put almost all of our savings back into the house. Zillow and Redfin now claim the house to be worth around 950k, and I'd say realistically we could 750 - 850 without much hassle. However, we have no plans to sell the house, nor do we want to.

Our roof is due for a replacement, and I will need to either use a credit card @ 11.99% or take a loan for 10k and use the house as collateral. 

Do I risk the house or make credit card payments at a higher interest rate? 

Would it make sense to borrow 30k to do a major overhaul on the house? In our long term plans we want to do Roof - &gt; Paint -&gt; Deck. It will probably cost less than 30, but there is much work for us to get done. Since we don't plan on selling the house, is it worth it to go further into debt or do these projects one at a time spaced out by a few years?

FinancialPlanning,"Hi! Can you help me — which of the following Vanguard options available in my retirement account are the most similar to VTSAX and VXUS? Optimally I’d split 75/25 VTSAX and VXUS but neither are available.

I don’t want to overcomplicate things, just want to set it and forget it, so splitting it up seven ways to achieve this exact split isn’t my goal either. Worst case I’d also take something similar to just one of the two funds (VTSAX/VXUS) and balance it out with investments elsewhere.

FinancialPlanning,"So, recently I(39F) had a job offer that would basically double my salary. I accepted it and I am starting in 2 months. My problem is that I always had trouble with saving money. Everything I earn, I spend. If i have lower income, I just don't buy that much stuff. If I have higher income, I just spent more and even if I save something I spent it in few months on something bigger (new phone, toys for kids, gifts for family, etc.)
I live with my partner and our three kids. My current income doesn't provide me with enough money to take care of the groceries for our whole family, so my partner supplements it (he send me 1/4 extra of what I earn in my job). We have this setup where I pay for day to day things + kids (school, clothes, hobbies), and he takes care of apartment bills, mortgage, car insurance and anything big ( vacation, new appliances, emergencies, etc.) He is very good at saving money, so this type of setup works well for us. Also, his income is like 3x mine at the moment. It is important to mention that we decide on those things together and if I feel the need to buy something (bicycle, for example) he has no problem with sending me the money or paying for it himself.
Now with the higher salary I am kinda afraid I will end up spending it all and I won't be able to save anything and I am already mad at myself 😅Does anyone has similar mindset and know how to deal with it?

FinancialPlanning,"Hello! 2022 was my first year having a taxable account. I used to have a financial advisor (lol) then realized that was a mistake, so I switched to Schwab. 

In April ‘22, I transferred over to Schwab. I “sold” what my advisor had for me and the form has all the transactions. 

Taxable account balance is currently around $20k

My qualified dividends is $129.87.

Ordinary dividends $224.69

Section 199A dividends is $5.87 lol

My income is only $38k take home after all deductions. Single no kids 


Anyone have any idea roughly what I’ll owe? 

I’m a beginner, so I’m definitely curious! The dividends amount. Is that the amount I owe? Or a percentage of the total amount? 

I know taxable account is last on the investment list but it doesn’t seem like I’ll owe much? As well as, is it just all factored in with everything tax wise? Or do I owe just on this account then everything else is separate? My W2 etc? Or is everything factored in then what I owe or get back is based on the total of everything?

1. Getting  another credit card and transferring the balance so I have more time to  pay it off (18-21 months). A 3% transfer fee would only be $95.
2. I  could get a card with 0% on purchases and all my daily spending on that  while I  pay down the Amex to avoid any transfer fees.

FinancialPlanning,"I recently had a family member who came to me and asked if I could add their name to one of my credit cards in order to help them with their credit repair process. I am obviously a little bit worried because my credit is as good as could be. And I use my credit to help better if my future. I use it to buy investment properties. So my credit needs to remain impeccable.

His family member as soon as they turned 18 immediately went out and destroyed their credit. It's been 7 years and he is settling some of the amounts and disputing some of the other accounts that he has not paid on. He is wanting to buy a house now and that is the reasoning behind him attempting to repair his credit. I've been telling him to do this for years I'm not sure what has suddenly changed he decided to do it. Even though his credit had been destroyed he has continued to be rather Reckless with his credit. He is married into the family and had the family member he married use their credit to get them an apartment. After their baby the one family member stopped working and he continued to work and handle the bills and then just didn't pay the rent on the apartment. He ended up getting kicked out and ruining her credit in the process.

So although I want to help I am extremely hesitant to do anything that would put my credit at any risk. The plan would be I would add him as an authorized user and he would have no access to that credit card that his name was also on. So there would be no way for him to spend any money on the credit card that we would ""share"". This would give him a boost in credit and ultimately once he purchased the house I could remove him from that credit card. However I feel that there is some sort of catch to this. It somehow raises his credit score but does not affect mine? That's what he is telling me. That information was relayed from a loan officer to him. So who knows what information is accurate or what he is being told in order to get the commission from the loan officer.

 With our only tie being One credit card I would have control over is there any sort of liability I would face? I would like to help him but knowing his history I do not trust that he would actually stay true to his word and keep his credit score up.

I make $80,000 USD: match my employers 401k (6%/3%), max out my HSA contributions, planning for $3000 towards my Roth IRA, and put away $400/month towards savings. With my current employer, I'm not vested until 2 years and it's only been 3.5 months. Also have ~$4500 in a 403b from previous employer, they were fully vested as soon as I started my contributions

I talked to my partner about it as well and he said he has $18k saved. I probed more and it's not even in a savings account, it's sitting in his checking account. I asked him about him moving some of it to a HYSA, but he didn't seem interested, this was around the time I opened my account with Ally about a month or so ago. He works for the university so contributes to the states retirement plan which he contributes 10%, they contribute 14%. He makes $45-46k.

FinancialPlanning,"So I've been investing into my 401k very aggressively since I started my career. Now I'm 35 and already have $700k USD in my 401k that's heavy on ETFs pegged to index funds. By the time I'm old enough to withdraw penalty free in 25 years, and assuming 8% returns per year, that'll be a nearly $5,000,000 account. The average yearly returns on that will be more than enough to live off of.  

So would it be worthwhile for me to reduce my 401k contributions to just enough to maximize my employer matching (no sense in leaving money on the table), and then put everything else into a brokerage account invested in the same ETFs?  Like should i de-prioritize my retirement saving at this point, and start investing more aggressively into accounts that I can more readily access *before* retirement, possibly funding an early retirement?

I know I'd lose out on the tax-advantaged nature of 401k's doing this, but i don't see much purpose in hoarding as much money as possible into my 401k at this point.

FinancialPlanning,"I have my first airline credit card (that I pay off and never hold a balance on. I just learned about bonus miles and I'm curious to learn more. From what I've read, most of them aren't worth it, but I wanted to get some advice.

I have a United card and right now, until the 28th, buying miles can get up to 85% bonus miles.

Right now, it's showing me that if I buy 2k miles, it's only $70, 3k is only $105, 4k is only $140, 5k+1500 bonus miles is $175.00

On first look, this seems like a really good deal. Especially living on the east coast, a lot of the travel I want to do is on the west coast. Tickets to Seattle are in the $900s right now (insane!).

FinancialPlanning,"I(21F) have recently became a bartender. Most of my monthly income comes from tips, which can be hit or miss but so far I have never made less than $4000 a month, usually a couple hundred over that. Before bartending I was a server making around $3000 a month. 

My monthly expenses are around $900-$1000 with bills and rent and all that, which means I’ve been able to save quite a bit in my cheap apartment. My current savings is at $33,000. 

I have no debt. my car is quite old and has a lot of miles so I probably will have to get another car soon. Due to complications at my apartment I also may have to move soon and have been looking at places around $800-$900 a month. I currently live alone but I suppose I could find a roommate.

FinancialPlanning,"Is there ever a situation where it makes sense to cash out a 401K early? Say, in order to pay off high interest debt? 

I’m in my mid 30s. I have a family. I owe just under $100K on my home. I’m currently in graduate school and will make $200-$300K annually once I graduate. I will likely have close to $300K in student loan debt when I’m done with school. (Some of that is from undergrad.)

Unfortunately, we also have somewhere between $20-$30K in credit card debt. This is a tough subject as a big portion of this debt was hidden from me. I didn’t find out about it until a I was already in grad school and no longer working. 

Monthly credit card payments are now high enough that I’m having to rely almost completely on student loans to live while I’m in school full time. My spouse works full time but most of that income goes to credit cards and a vehicle payment. This is why I expect to have so much student loan debt when I graduate. 

I’ve been paying into a 401K for 15 yrs. I believe I have somewhere around $120K between 2 different accounts. Would it make sense for me to cash out these accounts to pay off my high interest debts? I wouldn’t have to acquire as much student loan debt if the credit cards were paid off. Or is that a terrible idea?

FinancialPlanning,"Hi! My husband and I bring home about 250K. We have three kids. I work two part time jobs. One is self employment and the other is teaching. I’m earning a pension, but not much because I’m part time. I’m currently only saving into my own Roth IRA , but not maxed out. My husband is paying 10% into his 401K with a 5% employer match. Long back story…but I used to save into my 401K and a different state pension (not vested in that 😟), then stayed home with the kids and my husband didn’t start his career until 33 (he was a student for a loooonnngggg time lol). And we have been 10% saving into his 401K for about 6 years. Our only debt is two mortgages and student loans. My loans should get forgiven, his will not. We will pay them aggressively when payments resume. We have 6 months of an emergency fund. Our income has grown quickly and I plan to talk to my financial planner soon, but I wanted to ask here because I like some of the advice given about investing. What should we do for our next steps of saving? I think our total retirement savings about 230K.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello! This will most likely be a trauma dump of information but I think a lot of it is relevant. 

My mom is hitting 66 this year. My dad, her husband, died 3 years ago. My mother still works 2 days a week, sometimes less sometimes more. She gets social security each month coming in at about 950 a month, her earnings are about 1000 a month on the low side, 1500 on the high side for take home. She has these bills (rounded up) monthly:

Mortgage and all fees- $1200

Cable + Wifi- $250

Transport to and from work- $150 (she doesn't drive &amp; relies on cabs. public transport is non existent.)

Groceries/needs- $250- $300 

Pets- $100

Other/debt repayments- $250

Obviously that's very tight. Now here's the predicament 

She owns a house in a very desirable town. It's a mountain town and a very high cost of living area. If her house didn't have issues and was in nice condition she could probably sell it for close to 700k. She owes just over 100k on it, and we could most likely sell her house for 400k-550k. Probably closer to the 450k area as she hasn't done any maintenance, and the house has a looooooooot of issues.  As it stands now, it would have to be a cash sale as it's unlivable in some aspects, and probably couldn't be financed by someone. I personally have paid about $1000 for a plumber and bills in the last 4 weeks because she regularly has less than $100 to her name, and the winter has made her pipes burst and flood more than 4 times this year leaving her with no running water for days.

We have no family money, she has no retirement accounts or any safety nets to fall back on. I am just shy of 30 and make decent enough money, but I am also full time in school pursuing my degree, and about to move out of the hometown where this house is located.

Some more specifics

Owes on house &lt;105k, 2.4% interest 

Very high cost of living area in  California with harsh winters.

House is 3 bedroom 2 bath, but one bath is currently completely torn apart from flooding. Carpets from the 80s most likely, lots of ""work"" has been done by family friends over the last 20 years (who knows how well) Hasn't been painted inside since the 80s, maybe 90s. Kitchen has newer floors but not professionally installed. Lots of just stuff collected, has had cigarettes smoked in it for almost 30 years.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi there,

Please advice a plan to kill my debt.

I am 43yo and single earner in NJ making around 142k before taxes.

Only contribution that's going out of my paycheck is 150$ for 401k with match of 250$ from my comp, plus around 500$ goes in ESPP (15% discount).

I've saved around 10k for my elder one (8th grader) in UTMA and 7k for (2nd grader) in UTMA, plus my 401k stand at around: 65k as of today.

Every month I am trying to kill my debt but believe it or not I feel I am at the same place.

Can anyone helo me with some sort of plan to kill the debts as well as to grow the wealth peacefully. For 401k Loans it's for helping my extended family during covid times as they ran out of money and dental plan is for my elder one. Credit cards are primary household, because rents have gone up from 1500$ to 2200$ now and grocery and another expense net around 4 to 4.25k/month plus recently I booked a trip for my family almost after 5yr of staying home that costed me 6.5k.

I am putting money in ESPP as they are 15% discount and I've around 4k parked there which I can withdraw anytime I like (income will be clubbed in the year I bought them if I sale &lt;1yr).

I can share any other details (saving, expenses etc) you need to help me out.

FinancialPlanning,"I have been doing my own investing for 20+ years but thought it would be good to have another set of eyes on my plan from others who are experts in this space like you all fine folks at r/Bogleheads.

I would love to get some feedback and make sure I'm not missing anything. Especially since I have crossed over into 7 figure mark and would really appreciate any insights! :) Thank you in advance.

**Key Stats:**

* Married, 46 years old, 2 Children approaching college age
* Goal = Retire @ 55 year old (9 years away) w/ $3.0 million in invested assets ($120k/year @ 4%)
* Home: Fully Paid for, no mortgage

**Big Picture**: Stocks 80% vs Bonds 20%

* Total Invested Assets: $1.265 million @ Fidelity
* 56% US Stocks:
   * 14% in Fidelity Small Cap Value Index (FISVX)
   * 14% in Fidelity Small Cap Index (FSSNX)
   * 14% in Fidelity Large Cap Value Index (FLCOX)
   * 14% in Fidelity S&amp;P500 Index (FXAIX)
   * (Note: 25% each of this cohort based on the Paul Merman 4 Fund Combo).
* 24% International Stocks: Fidelity Total International Index (FTIHX)
* 15% US Bonds: Fidelity US Bond Index (FXNAX)
* 5% International Bonds: Fidelity International Bond Index (FBIIX)

**Details**:

* In terms of Fund Placement Optimization, I have all Bonds held in 401k and prioritize International Equities in my Taxable Account to the extent that I can.
* I max out my 401k &amp; 2 backdoor Roth IRAs each year (wife and myself). I also do additional investing in a brokerage account when possible with the goal to invest $70k/year in new money overall.
* I donate my highest appreciated securities in my taxable brokerage account to my DAF annually and repurchase new equities with cash otherwise given to charity to step up my basis and limit capital gains in the future.
* I rebalance based on the above model annually.

**Questions**:

* Feedback on the current 80% Stocks vs 20% Bond Split with \~10 year horizon? This is based on a Personal Financial Plan that Vanguard developed for me that calls for changing to 75/25 next year (9 to 6 years out from retirement).
* Thoughts on doing Paul Merriman 4 Fund? His walk through and research seems compelling even though it introduces a little complexity to manage 4 Funds @ 25% vs just doing the Total US Stock Market Index. I sometimes think I should just simplify this down to FSKAX. Would love insights here. I don't mind managing it, but want to make sure I am not leaving returns on the table
* In addition to my $1.265 million invested assets above, I also am a shareholder in a private company that likely will IPO in the next few years. It is an international tech company, so valuations swing wildly, but my best guess is my stake is worth $1 - 4 million. I do not factor this into my balancing above. Thoughts on this approach vs factoring it into my balancing?
* Realistically, is there any strategy to offset my exposure to high capital gains in the event of a large IPO event? I have only come up with moving to a no income tax state like FL or TN to reduce my state tax hit above the capital gains mark. Or potentially purchasing real estate which I shudder at the thought of doing. Any other insights?",t2_9wggaekr,0,Would love feedback on my Investment Plan/Portfolio!

FinancialPlanning,"I am at a 641, raised my credit score by over 310 pts last year!

I am very careful with loans, so my score was so low due to not really having credit and getting hit by every missed payment. My payment history is 98% 😅 but with no credit really built even a few missed / forgotten payments can hit hard.

I have currently 4 derogative accounts and 3 loans.

Loans:

Car - 6,000.00

Electronics - 2,000.00

Derogatives:

Medical - 130.00

Old Dusty Utility Bill from 10 yrs ago: 180.00 😆😅

I can't find help online, so maybe you 700+ credit saavy folk can help.

I'll have 1000.00 from tax refund to pay down some debts, and wanted to know if I get more points paying all 1k to a big bill, say my loans, or if I get more points paying say 100-150.00 on each item?

Should I just pay my derogatives a little each?

My credit rating is super tender, because I have small established credit; so every significant enough change to my balances could be 8-15pts per item.

I think I can easily get 60-80pts at this time if I pay right. Any tips? 🤔

FinancialPlanning,"Hi all. I’m 22 years old. Very fortunate to have received a job opportunity to travel (I’m a performer) and make some money while taking a year off of school. I’ll be graduating in this Winter with little to no student debt thanks to my parents 🙏🏻

I make about $780/week on my contract, spending roughly $200/week on food and putting the rest into my savings. I’m saving up as much as possible for two big expenses this summer (engagement ring and traveling to Mexico). This is where I stand in savings/investments:

Savings: $7,500
ROTH IRA: $1,300
Index fund account: $3,500

I’m planning to have around $18,000 in my savings when my contract is over in June and I’ll be spending about half of that on the ring and travel. I’m planning to move to NYC sometime in 2024 so I’m wanting to have as much saved up as possible for that as well. 

I haven’t been contributing to my ROTH or index fund, since I’m wanting liquid cash that I’ll be using within the next 6 months.

FinancialPlanning,"[**QUESTION**]I’ve (31m) recently run into problems with credit card debt that has accumulated to the point to where all of the monthly payments combined are becoming overwhelming. I’m not a financial-minded person, in all honesty, I’m a musician and my brain really has no interest in world events and politics. I bring this up only because in retrospect of the past couple of years, “inflation” has been a particularly hot buzz-word around the world and a lot of my problems I feel stem from that.

10 years ago, I made relatively the same amount of money I do now working in a music store as my 9-5 and I love it, I supplement my income as a professional free-lance audio engineer and composer, I get to live my dream and it’s been great. However, that being the case, some years are better than others financially, but doing all of this I’ve been able to support myself with a vehicle that’s paid off (bought new) and have food in the fridge with a roof over my head.

In the past couple of years though, I’ve noticed as prices have gone up on nearly EVERYTHING, what once used to be a $50 weekly grocery run has now skyrocketed to to a weekly $125 at LEAST. Gas has gone up and overall my rent and insurance plans have all increased at least $80! As a single guy, all of that adds up and I’ve had to rely on my credit cards to help me stay afloat. I’ve taken measures to help alleviate monthly costs, (cancelling subscriptions, buying cheaper groceries and securing a raise at my 9-5 while increasing my free-lance rates) but these changes will take time to make a difference and the damage has already been done. 

One of the endeavors I’m looking to embark on is consolidating my accrued credit card debt with my bank, but I’m naive in how this process works and what it entails of. What I’m HOPING for is to take the nearly $300 a month I’m spending on separate credit card payments and bring that cost down to something a bit more manageable. My question to you all is this: 

Will this decision give me the aforementioned outcome I’m seeking? How does it work and will my credit score be affected? What do banks look for when beginning a process such as this?

FinancialPlanning,"Back Door Roth IRA and 401k #Advice

My husband (32) and I (26) make too much a year to contribute to a Roth IRA, but I’ve been reading about doing a back door Roth IRA but can’t figure out how to avoid the tax from moving the money from the traditional to Roth IRA. Can anyone explain the loophole to me?

Also looking for advice on how much to be contributing to my 401k. In the past I never had a job that allowed me to invest in a 401k so my husband and I decided to have him contribute 20% (match included)to his so it would be enough to cover both of us in retirement. He currently has over 150k in his retirement account.

Should we reduce my husband’s 401k contributions to just his match (6% match) and start having me contribute 20% (match included) to catch my 401k up. We could also max out my 401k for the next few years if that makes sense.

I feel like I am going to be in a bad spot in 30 years if my emergency fund is depleted or I have a big home repair or medical bill. The future is uncertain.

I was looking at moving the Tbills after maturity into the 3 fund port (VTI,BND, VXUS) getting a small dividend 2%, and letting the portfolio grow over time. I will be very strapped for cash if I do this at only $8700 a year in income, but I will be invested. Another option is to go to the fixed income route in stocks and get about 3.5% yield with SCHD, VNQ, ETC...

This is confusing to me because most of the vanguard or investing sites show you how to allocate when you want to retire or at a certain age group, but what if you are retired at a young age what do you do? How do you allocate if that's the case?

FinancialPlanning,"I am a 23-year-old who currently earns around $85,000 per year. I have saved a little over $40,000 in the bank, mostly while pursuing my bachelor's and master's degrees. My biggest expense is my car, which I financed for $38,000 with a 0.90% APR last year. I still owe $32,000, which I plan to pay off in 2 to 3 years. I currently live with my parents, who kindly allow me to stay with them without paying rent. I am considering moving out on my own, but that won't happen for another four years at least. 

Now that I have a stable job, I'm interested in investing my money for retirement. My plan is to put 80 to 90 percent of my $40,000 savings into a high-yield savings account. I'm thinking of investing the rest, along with a significant portion of my monthly income, in treasury bonds and index mutual funds. I recently read ""The Elements of Investing"" by B. Malkiel and C. Ellis, which suggests maintaining a 60/40 ratio of stocks to bonds on an annual basis. I'm considering following this strategy but would love to learn more from experienced savers first. Are there any better strategies for saving with compound interest? Should I consider opening a CD account instead or something else entirely?

FinancialPlanning,"Each year we receive a sizable bonus (relative of course) and this year I'm curious what the smartest thing to do would be.  I have about 13k in credit card debt that I could wipe out entirely when the bonus hits.  The one key about that 13k is that none of it is currently accruing interest (multiple no interest if paid off in x amount of time) cards.  For each card, I pay just over the amount per month needed to guarantee that I never pay interest in the long term.  I should also point out that the monthly payments are not hurting us or detracting from our quality of life.   

Then we have our mortgage that I've been paying down as aggressively as I can.  It obviously IS an interest-bearing account, 3.25% precisely.  

I HATE being in debt and I want with everything in my soul to just pay off the 13k entirely when the money hits.  That said, I feel like it makes way more sense to pay down the principal of our mortgage as aggressively as possible since we're paying interest.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello all,

I’m currently looking at leasing an apartment (California) for $2300. My SO and I have a combined total gross income of about 90k/ 95k (we live together). Utilities are not included (water, sewage, trash). I’m contributing 6% to my 401k ($150/ paycheck biweekly) and very little to my HSA. We also have car insurance (combined $250) and I have my monthly car bill($560), phone and internet ($200), and electricity ($40). 

Based on all of this info, is it advisable to go for an apartment that expensive? I obviously didn’t count gas or food into the budget because that’s variable. 

Because of taxes, it feels like I earn way less. My boyfriend’s job isn’t set, as in he works his own hours so he could make more (not substantially) or less.

Also, I’m aware $2300 is relatively low for California, however we previously had a roommate and would be going from $650 each to $1000+.

If you need more info, let me know

FinancialPlanning,"Most of the literature I read about financial security during early retirement (or retirement in general) usually involve formulas that take into account spending habits/ yearly expense to determine whether one's nest egg is enough for retirement based on lifestyle.

I've mostly worked overseas as an expat so I haven't had to pay for many of the things I would pay for in the States (housing, utilities, insurance) I recently got married and my wife is also an expat. We have taken advantage of our opportunities by maximizing our savings and investing most of our income, to the point that I'm now thinking about the feasibility of early retirement. The tricky part is I don't have a good sense of what our yearly expenses could be once we are no longer working as expats.

This leads to my question as I explore the possibility of early retirement. Because most of our major expenses were covered these past several years (and will continue to be for the foreseeable future) , it's hard to gauge what our yearly expenses might look like. 

I've looked up data online about cost of living in various cities in the US and I imagine I can use that as a gauge. I've also talked to friends in various cities to get a sense about their general expenditures but I'm wondering if anyone here has other ideas for how I can assess the viability of early retirement and plan more intentionally for it.

Some info that might be helpful.

I'm 38. Wife is 31. NW is around USD 880k.

Expenses, as mentioned, are quite low. We maybe spend 1,000-1,200 USD a month. Net income depends on the country where we work. It ranges from 10-15k USD/ month and we save/ invest most of it.

In terms of lifestyle, again this is tricky. We do eat out and travel quite a bit but we tend to do so in countries where cost of living is quite cheap and travel opportunities are easy to come by. Every time we visit family in the states, we enjoy cooking since we have access to grocery items we don’t always have overseas.

Timeline I’m thinking of for early retirement might be in 5-7 years. 

We don’t own a place in the US at the moment and aren’t too keen about the idea of buying a place. But we could consider it.

TLDR: because of our jobs, we haven’t gotten a sense of what our yearly expenses might look like.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi there,

First time poster here. 

My wife and I are looking to purchase a car. (We are in Canada). A lot of financing rates right now are varying around 5.5-8.9% from what I have seen from several dealerships. We also have a line of credit available to us that we would be able to use to pay for the vehicle almost outright but the interest rate on the LoC is 11.19% because of all the rate hikes from the federal govt to curb inflation. 

My thought is that if we pay it on our LoC we can pay as much as we want, when we want? We are both educators so we don’t make nearly as much money in the summer months. Also, if we take out another loan when we already have a registered LoC, that is one less ding on our financials/credit score?

I am wondering if there is any other unknown benefit that I may be missing to doing this? I am aware I would probably be paying more interest on the LoC. 

Basics of what we are looking at;
Suv: around 55000.
New or almost new with minimum kms.

I am not incredibly literate when it comes to car financing so I appreciate any advice given. Please and thank yous in advance.",t2_21y4s1,0,Purchasing a car - Finance or use line of credit with higher rate?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,115s6h9,True,QuantumZucchini,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/115s6h9/purchasing_a_car_finance_or_use_line_of_credit/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/115s6h9/purchasing_a_car_finance_or_use_line_of_credit/,536787,1676755583,0,,False,1676755602,1676755603,2023-02-18 21:26:23,,,,,,,
FinancialPlanning,"I (25f) currently work in a bar that honestly makes me depressed, I hate my job and I've been working in the same establishment since I was 14.  I desperately want to do a coding bootcamp so I can begin my journey into software engineering, but financially I feel I cannot afford to start the class and I'm not in a position that will at any point make me enough money to start either.  I have a few options, but I'm so scared of making a bad decision that will be detrimental to me and my husband in the long run.  

Option 1. Finance the class through the school.
- I will have to pay $600 a month for two years, something I truly cannot afford, but if I can get a good enough job within the first few months I believe we could swing the payments.  
- There would be no interest rate for this option, but I would be locked into the high payments.  

Option 2. Get a personal loan through my credit union. 
- If I do this I would pay the schooling in full before classes begin, which would give me a $1,000 discount on the course.  I could have a loan that will be set up to be paid over a longer period of time and therefore have lower monthly payments.  I could then pay it off early once I have a better paying job.  
- I'm unsure what exactly the interest rate would be, my husband and I both have fairly good credit scores, 750+, but we currently have a mortgage and car payment under our names and I'm worried we could get denied.

FinancialPlanning," 

Is it financial correct to go solar? Let's try to consider all factors at the current moment.

Lets say it costs someone $35,000 to go solar for 100% offput on their current bill. (The bill will still be like $10 fixed rate) They do get rebates that end up making the purchase come out to $22,000 after incentives within 18 months.

Lets say their current power bill is avg $110 a month. Let's say inflation is atleast at a 3% annual rate and electric company will increase electric rates as well but unknown amount.

Also solar panels decrease in power production .5% a year, so they degrade. There is a 25 yr performance guarentee so lets say no cost of maintenance for this time. But guaranteed to be at 87.5% percent output in 25 years. It increases the home for resale value 4.1% but could increase home insurance rates around $175 at current rates.

Does this make sense to pay cash and go solar from a financial investment time pay-off perspective rather investing the let's just say $22,000 in a investment account at a 6% (or whatever) growth? Is there ever a point where there is a pay off period?

Now let's say they can take out a 26.5 yr loan making the payment about $199 a month. Don't have to start making loan payments until 18 months in so actually only making 25 yrs of payments. (Also keep in mind even though the payment becomes $199 they are getting (actually increases to $16,000 incentives when you take out a loan instead of $13,000 when paying cash) in federal tax and other cash incentives to switch within the first year, I am not sure if that decreases the face amount of the loan or payoff period...There are other loans too 10 yr 3yr with different fees and interest rates. Is this a better situation to go solar or worst?",t2_aui2rmia,0,Financially Makes Sense to Switch to Solar?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,115lxjp,True,Themandudedudeman,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/115lxjp/financially_makes_sense_to_switch_to_solar/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/115lxjp/financially_makes_sense_to_switch_to_solar/,536700,1676745315,0,,False,1676745334,1676745334,2023-02-18 18:35:15,,,,,,,

FinancialPlanning,"My parents do well. They have a fancy bank who tells them winter is coming; a recession, they’re moving a lot into bonds, my 401k is mostly recovered but it’s 80% stock.

I read consumer savings dropped below that of the financial recession and consumer debt is higher… cost of living is higher, cars are more expensive, everything is… at what point will people stop paying off their loans and bring about another Great Recession?

The government has over twice the debt it had last time. If D.C needs to bail out industries such as banking or automotive… do they still have the money to stabilize things? I’m told if they hadn’t bailed out Wall Street it would have been the Great Depression again, minus the dust bowl.

I just wonder if I should go to 100% bonds bc we might not hit what I was at before but it’d be better than being down a ton. I also want to be in a place where I can rapidly move the money back to undervalued companies.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi there! I’m in a spiral figuring out the best way to give my almost 1 year old the best future and step forward in life.
I started with researching life insurance plans and the Gerber Grow Up Plan.
I then read some more and a few different articles noted that the smarter way to go is investing in a mutual fund for them.

This is all Greek to me, I’m not the “get a financial advisor” type, I’m certainly not wealthy- but I think a small monthly investment for her future is certainly manageable. 

I have no clue where you buy a mutual fund, if it’s truly worth it, how you withdraw your money, how you get returns at all… 

The Acorns app was suggested as well, but I read some reviews, and it has sort of scared me off of that idea.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi everyone, as the title says I am 25 years old and currently have $75k in cash not really doing anything for me. I have a solid job making ~$80k/year with an employer that matches my 409b. I am here to get some opinions on what to do with this money so I can hopefully retire early one day. I am not a home owner and currently rent. I would also like to note that I already have about $50k in mutual tech and retail funds invested. I've recently been researching about financial planning and took the first step of opening a HYSA (finally), and to start off I put $30k of my cash in there just so that it can start to do something (last week). I am wondering what to do with the rest of the money? I see a lot of talk about CD's and I-Bonds, but from what I concluded you're not going to make much after adjusted for inflation. My employer matches my 409b at 6%, so I am currently contributing that, but I know the recommendation for most people is to invest 10-15% of earnings into a retirement account. My only hesitation right now is I am not completely familiar with the differences between a 409b and a Roth IRA. I am unsure if I should increase my contributions to my 409b or stay at 6% and open a Roth IRA to invest the rest. What are your guys opinions regarding what to do with my liquid cash as well as my retirement contributions?

FinancialPlanning,"Been helping my in laws with getting their finances in order for retirement and ran into something that didn't quite sit right with me, so hoping for expert feedback here:

My FIL has a DC plan from a union job he left over a decade ago. In filling out the paper work for the direct rollover they had an ""insert"" of a policy change effectively restricting how the funds are withdrawn in lumpsums and direct roll overs. Effectively you mail in the paper work, assuming they get it before the 15th of that month, they will ""process"" it some time in the following 2 calendar months (i.e. they receive before Feb 15th, they will potentially not mail the rollover until April 30th). Furthermore, they will only release 85% of the balance at that time. The remaining funds will be ""disbursed after the close of the next calendar quarter"" which puts us into July or later depending on how you read that.

This all seems sketchy and underhanded, especially since the form we receive looked like it was scanned/reprinted 37 times over the years. A quick bit of research shows they are on notice from the DOL with an endangered status.

Totally understand the difficulty in managing direct rollovers/lump sums like that given these pensions/annuity plans tend to invest in private equity and other illiquid assets all the time, but it feels like they are effectively holding your money hostage until they feel like releasing it. I couldn't find anything in erisa that was obvious to me around their ability to restrict lump sums withdrawals like that. 

Is this all above board? He's not in desperate need of that money (it's being rolled into a healthy IRA) but the whole thing hasn't been sitting well with me.

FinancialPlanning,"GPT - ""There are several ways to grow your credit with a credit card. Here are some tips:

Make on-time payments: Pay your credit card bills on time every month to avoid late fees and negative marks on your credit report.

Keep your balance low: Try to keep your credit utilization ratio (the amount of credit you're using compared to your total credit limit) below 30%. A high utilization ratio can negatively impact your credit score.

Use your card regularly: Using your credit card regularly and responsibly can help you build a positive credit history.

Don't apply for too many cards at once: Applying for multiple credit cards in a short period of time can lower your credit score.

Consider a secured credit card: If you're new to credit or have a low credit score, a secured credit card can be a good option. With a secured card, you'll need to put down a security deposit, which serves as collateral in case you don't make your payments.

Monitor your credit score: Regularly check your credit score and credit report to ensure that everything is accurate and to track your progress in building your credit.

Remember, building good credit takes time and responsible credit behavior.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello Reddit! 

So my 19 year old self made a dumb decision that has put myself in a financial problem early on in a way. I purchased a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta SEL back in September but with my credit score being a 730 at the time with no history a loan payment, as well as not having a co-signer my APR is 15% on my auto loan and my monthly payments are $502 a month. Pair that with a $411 insurance bill and you have a total cost of $903 a month for a car which is ridiculous.

Does anyone have any advice on how I could refinance to get that APR down and monthly payment down so I could actually have a savings? Due to how many times the dealership ran my credit I have to work on it again to get it back to what it may need to be, but I don't know what the requirements are to get approved for refinancing.

Long story short I gross roughly $110k annually, have a 401k, and $30k in the bank.

I have two credit cards I’m paying off this month. After that I want to maximize my money. 

I was going to take about $10k from my savings and drop that into a HYS account, and take another $1k to put in my safe for cash on hand, and then monthly contributing to a Roth and the HYS.

FinancialPlanning,"**Biographical Information**

I was a happily employed person up until a few months back when I was smacked in the face with schizoaffective disorder.  Turns out those horror stories of getting a sudden serious mental disorder in your mid 20s are real, who knew?  The kicker is that my suddenly-unhinged behavior got me fired from my sweet gig with cause, so no unemployment for me.  Great stuff.  I'm doing great.

I'll be out of work for the next six or so months while I get this sorted out and I could use some advice.  I'm a single 26F and will be moving in with family and will be on Medicaid.  I think six months is a little lengthy for how much time I'll actually need, and I've historically been very employable.  So, *in six months I expect to be surviving and earning enough to float by.*  

I have a mortgage and just hired a property management company to rent out my house.  It is unlikely I will do anything beyond break even on rent, so no income there.  I like the house and plan on keeping it, god willing. Currently I don't have a renter but am hoping to find someone too.  It's new construction and if it does not rent in 3 months I will look into selling. 

**Here's my current picture:**

* $18k in Roth IRA (all contributions, got boned by the market in the last three years. no contributions in 2023)
* $18k vested in company owned 401k
* About $4k in checking
* No debt other than mortgage

I'm in a pretty good spot, all things considered.  

To stay afloat, *I need about $2k/month until I get a renter, which will drop it to $500/month.*  

**Here's the question:**

I will have to liquidate some amount of my retirement in the situation that I can't get a renter, or if there is an unexpected repair on the property.  Is it recommended that I begin by withdrawing the Roth IRA contributions, since they are penalty-free?  Should I leave my 401k sit with my previous employer or should I roll it into a different account?  Any other recommendations on how to keep myself afloat?

\---

Before anyone says it, doesn't sound like disability is an option for me and I very much plan to be back in my industry in the not-so-distant future.  I'm just concerned about making the best decisions now, as I know I'm young enough that touching my retirement accounts can potentially mean tens of thousands of dollars of difference down the line.

FinancialPlanning,"Short version -- someone I know more than once has insisted that even if you were to suddenly end up +$20,000,000 USD net in your pocket, that unless you lived off that raw capital, you can't properly retire. 

Basically, that any sort of index or mutual funds to live off of dividends is totally non-viable.

I am light years from any kind of expert on this, but from what I saw it's not unreasonable with even conservative investing in those things to increase the value by 5-6% year over year, right? That almost seems to be the expected normal baseline, I think?

That'd be +$1,000,000 a year. I tried to explain that even with some wild 50% tax rate, if you simply took out half your yearly gains as a payout, you'd still be living off of basically *NET* $250,000 USD in today's money, or $4800 a week if you felt like budgeting.

The person disagrees, insisting there's nothing outside ""private funds"" that ""mega rich only"" can use that get results like that.

FinancialPlanning,"Greetings all, throwaway account because my real Reddit is a small business account. 

Essentially, I work a very fruitful career. I make around $100k a year, and year two pay is roughly $230k. I’m just at the beginning of it all. 

I have a credit score currently of 720. I do not own a house, or much at all. I finance a car, and rent an apartment. That’s it. I made the decision to buy a family heirloom car, that the current owner agreed to sell for $20,000. Not having the immediate cash to buy I took a personal loan in the amount to not lose out on this deal. 

I’m not purchasing the item until June 1st (needs inspecting, transporting, etc). I have a credit line of roughly $25,000 over my 3 credit cards. One card in particular has a $4,000 balance on it. The others are maybe 5-10% usage. 

I make roughly $8k a month currently. Is it worth it to pay off that balance now, using the personal loan and the presumption I’ll save up the $4,000 for the car I’m buying before June, or just continue paying my cards off per paycheck?

FinancialPlanning,"Hi! So i’m a college student and I have been relying on student loans and financial aid to pay for my studies. A couple of months ago I received 1,000 dollars from my parents as gift for Christmas (no we are not rich, I live far away from my parents and they assumed I needed help with rent, groceries, etc) so I decided to use 500 of those for myself and get me some clothes. I asked one of my family members from my country if they could get me clothes from my country and I would send them the money through Western Union as a payment for the clothes.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi everyone! Just looking for some “what would you do?” advice. 

Right now my family and I live in upstate NY and hate it, the weather, most of the people, taxes, nothing to do etc. We are both full time working parents, one of which makes 65k a year and the other 70k. Ultimately we’d like for one of us to get some type of civil service/government job for the benefits/pensions etc. We own a home and pay 1200/mo mortgage (property taxes escrowed in that). We have one child (2.5 years old) and another on the way. We have 5 cats (I know 😳 but our house is still exceptionally clean and organized).

We have debt totaling around 50k (this includes all of our credit cards, personal loans and one auto loan of 9k).

Our home is worth around 200k-210k (maybe more) and we owe 112k.

We filed ch. 13 back in 2018, and it’ll be discharged (finally!) in spring of next year. We are allowed to sell our house and keep the proceeds as we’d please. 

We’ve thrown the idea around of moving down south (FL in particular is our dream location) for some time now but we couldn’t figure out how to make it work until our kids would be in school, (finding and paying for daycare could be a hassle). I just came across a state job in the Tampa area that pays 70k to start. I’ve interviewed for jobs in FL in my field but this is the highest paying so far, in my field.

We’re wondering if we should sell our house, use the proceeds to pay off literally all of our debts so we can get a fresh start and move into an apartment until we can find a house next year once the chapter 13 is officially discharged.

I would be the only one working while my wife stayed with the kids at home, until they started school so we didn’t need to worry about daycare expenses. I’m not sure what apartment would allow 5 cats but we could never just dump them, we’d never be able to live comfortably knowing we did that to them, so that’s another issue we’d have to figure out. 

If we didn’t move and stayed in our current positions, then we could just work out a payoff plan for our debts and try to get a civil service job around here. We just have nothing keeping us here besides our families and very few friends.

FinancialPlanning,"I'm currently a second semester freshman undergrad in university. I'm looking to invest some money to pay for medical school tuition and living expenses.

I'm super fortunate to have a scholarship that allows me to be able to complete my bachelor's degree with no debt. Also, I'm currently working as a student researcher that pays me about $600 a month ($2400 a month during winter and summer breaks), most of which I can invest into my future education. Additionally, I'm able to start with an \~$1000 initial investment. I'm very thankful for the opportunities presented to me to allow my financial health during these undergraduate years.

How should I invest this money to have a slight profit when paying for medical school \~3.5-4.5 years down the line? I've seen accounts specifically for higher education expenses like the 529, though I'm not exactly sure how to apply it in my situation (am a New York state resident attending school in another state).

How would this impact the potential financial aid I would get from medical schools? My family does not have the financial resources to support further education and I will be relying on financial aid and my investment to put me through (with hopefully minimal debt).

I currently have a brokerage account opened with Merrill Edge and would like to stick to it if possible.

FinancialPlanning,"This may be an obvious question, but in the case of a tax-free windfall, it seems it would better to park that whole amount immediately into long term mutual funds rather than meting it out over a number of years into my (unmatched) 403b and 457b accounts. Does that sound right? 

Of course I’d lose the tax break from reduced income bracket, but it seems the extra time in the market and also paying the capital gains tax instead of income tax in distributions would make it more advantageous. Am I correct in thinking this? 

And yes, I know I definitely need to and definitely will talk to a CFP, I just haven’t yet.

FinancialPlanning,"I'm curious about what the general consensus will be on this question. Should I pay off a 30K auto loan at 3.75% OR put the $ into my MMA with a 3.2% interest rate? Here are the reasons that I'm considering each option: 

Paying the loan off: 

1. The instant savings of 3.75% vs 3.2%. 

2. Getting the cash flow back monthly. 

3. the weight of owing on it goes away.

Putting the $ into my MMA: 

1. We have a list of home improvements that we want to do that are going to cost money and if I finance them it will likely be at a higher rate than 3.75%. 

Long term investing isn't an option for the use of this money because I know that we'll be spending money in the next year, but I'm already maxing out 401k, my home mortgage is at 2.75% so I won't be paying that off early and I don't have any other interest-bearing loans.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello all,

I'm faced with a dilemma, buying a home for my family or buying an asset. I'm relatively new to truly thinking about finance with the difference perspective I've recently acquired. I've worked hard for the past 4 years to build a savings that I can now invest but I've been extremely fearful.

I've been super happy about buying a home for my self and family but for some odd reason, I decided to read the book ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" a couple days after receiving one of many pre-approval letters. I really don't know why I decided to finally take up the suggestion I've obtained from many.. but I did.

My outlook has changed considerably, even though it was already there.. it's just seen in a different light now, especially at this moment.

Emotions aside, I think for obvious reasons, obtaining asset is the best.. like property and stock portfolio. This will generate wealth that will allow more doors to open. It's like I feel to know the answer, but I feel like it's not common... so then is it really the right choice?

The market currently is horrible where I am located. 45-60 days ago it was much better. I truly don't want to rent, but my new thinking has me brainstorming ways to use that as an advantage.. at least for now.",t2_swxmrkjn,0,My first investment dilemma - buying a home or investing and renting,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,111u2f3,True,Thewavyman,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/111u2f3/my_first_investment_dilemma_buying_a_home_or/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/111u2f3/my_first_investment_dilemma_buying_a_home_or/,533627,1676349920,0,,False,1676349936,1676349936,2023-02-14 04:45:20,,,,,,,

So me and my wife are both 25, live in Orlando fl. Currently renting, our lease is up in June, and we are really wanting to get a house before then (we also are expecting our first kid in Sept!).

I also have quite a bit of money saved up that I would like to keep saved incase anything was to arise. My last question is, would it be better to get a loan through my personal bank (Wellsfargo), or go through a mortgage lender like quickenloans?

FinancialPlanning,"Was wondering if anyone could give me some clarity on potential tax deductions.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep it short.

&amp;#x200B;

In past few years I have also been investing heavily, in part in dividend stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

This year I have began selling option contracts with overall good success.

&amp;#x200B;

Come tax season now I have an approximate bill of $10k that I have to pay and that will most likely rise to $12k after another account sends me tax forms, this is mainly due to capital gains from option contracts that I've been selling.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have been looking into buying a rental property in order to be able to start real estate investing, as well as being able to deduct some expenses against my other incomes.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions is what are the limitations of this?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a vague example:

&amp;#x200B;

For example I make $20,000 Capital Gains in a year from non-qualified dividends and contract selling.

and for example I take a $200 loss per month on a rental property.

With all the rental property deductions I will break even or maybe even take a loss against the rental income.

But then I will have let's say about $12,000 deduction from rental property depreciation.

Am I able to deduct these $12,000 against my passive income from stock market capital gains?

“The Golden 4” 
Civic
Accord
Camry
Corolla

I’m in my early 20s and I’m also building my credit. I plan to get an auto loan from my credit union after one year of having credit. What I’m worried about is that these dealerships wanting more out of me and giving me a 36 month or shorter term forcing the monthly payment to increase. I don’t want dealerships thinking, “OP is putting a big down payment to lower the monthly payment, let’s get OP into a shorter term contract to get more out of OP every month.” But that statement wouldn’t make sense because wouldn’t they get more out of me by having me in a longer contract (60+ months) to have me pay more in interest in the long run right? I want to finance for 48 months and get an open contract to have the option every month to pay more if I want. But $170 is max for me.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello,

My wife and I are in our mid 20’s. We made right at $300k combined in 2022. I contributed $6,000 at the beginning of 2022 towards my Roth IRA not knowing or expecting for us to exceed the individual and combined income limits for Roth contributions. 

I got a big promotion at work, and she is a realtor - and 2022 was a great year for her (she is 100% commission, and about half of my pay is performance related). That being said, I believe I need to withdraw my 2022 contribution to my Roth IRA to avoid paying penalties. 

I’ve read up on the back door roth, but I am not 100% clear how it works. It seems like you create a traditional IRA, and convert that into a roth. Do you do this every year? Meaning multiple roth accounts? Seems like it would be annoying to keep up with in the future. I’m just wondering what I should do about my 2022 contribution, and for the years moving forward. I do have a 401k - planning to max out each year moving forward. I believe I contributed 18k in 2022.

Should I get a financial advisor? We do pretty well. No debt except our home. Good savings, etc. just trying to make sure we make the right moves today so we can retire comfortable in the future.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello, I (23F) am a bit stumped on my next steps to secure my retirement/future, could I be doing more? 

I graduated college about a year and a half ago, I have no student loan debt (paid for out of pocket) I own two cars that I paid cash for, and recently bought a house, valued at 170k but I bought it for 125 and the loan amount is 100k. I have about ~15k in savings 4k in checking, and 4k in various stocks separate from retirement funds.

I don't make a lot of money, about 1,200 bi-weekly, 900 of that goes twords my mortgage each month leaving me with 1800 for whatever else. I work in the public sector so I will have a pension after 5 years (planning on working there longer though), but I put $40 per paycheck into a deferred compensation account, and 100$ a month into my Roth IRA mostly into S&amp;P 500.

My question- I have extra money each month, should I be using the extra to paying off the principle of my mortgage? Put more into my Roth? Or should i just save it for now? It would only be a couple hundred but I want to make sure it's getting the most 'growth'

However.

My car goes to the shop in 20 days. We will be car-less. He gets just under 10k for his car in about a few days. Can he get a car loan without a job and a terrible credit score if we use said money as a down payment? Or should we wait until our luck turns?

FinancialPlanning,"Being responsible for the shepherding of the entire life savings of Retirees for more than 20 years, the ‘2 phases of Investing’ concept is one of the most basic (yet not commonly discussed) pieces of info our clients have provided feedback as being most useful out of the gate.  Anyone investing $, despite amounts, will go through the following 2 phases……each containing polar opposite goals &amp; objectives of the other.  

ACCUMULATION PHASE :  Most commonly discussed / best understood phase w/ 3 main objectives

1. SAVE / invest money for use in the FUTURE
2. GROWTH = Primary Investment Objective 
3. Risk Tolerance - moderate to high

DISTRIBUTION PHASE : Not commonly discussed / leasr understood phase w/3 main objectives 

1. SPEND $ ALREADY SAVED
2. PRESERVATION over Growth = Primary Investment Objective
3. Risk Tolerance - low to moderate

As you can see, each phase is inversely opposite to the other.  Therefore, it would seem logically obvious that in order to meet the goals and objectives of each phase, one would LIKELY NOT SELECT NOR USE THE SAME INVESTMENT VEHICLES FOR BOTH PHASES.  Keep this in mind whenever working w/ Financial Advisors, as only a small percentage are experts in Distribution Phase…with vast majority being experts in Accumulation Phase.  

I hope this 30k foot overview aids you in your Retirement Planning, specifically helps readers make INFORMED decisions as to their hard earned life savings.

FinancialPlanning,"So recently I got my first full time job at the ripe old age of 19 after not being allowed to have anything that involved money. I've been wanting to move out since I was about 12 or 13 but wasn't able to obviously. The place I'm looking at right now is about 700$ a month utilities not included and I have 4 cats (25$ rent for each cat) (switching 2 of them out every week as they can't stand being away from me and I'm the same to them) 

I make about 2240$ per month before taxes come out of it. I don't have a car as I haven't gotten my license so I have to take public transport, it is free with my college id but it takes a bit. 

I only recently have started paying the water bill and rent to build up some credit. I want to move out ASAP but i also need to save up at least 175$ per month for a trip I'm taking in late late August. 


Does anyone know if I'll be able to move out. I'm scared but I've wanted to do this forever and I've wanted to work since I was 12 and I just want to get away so if there is any advice for ways I can make this work please let me know!",t2_snkejl6e,0,I'm 19 and need to get out of my house but only make 2k a month. any advise?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,1103cpn,True,SilverQrow425,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1103cpn/im_19_and_need_to_get_out_of_my_house_but_only/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/1103cpn/im_19_and_need_to_get_out_of_my_house_but_only/,531924,1676164439,0,,False,1676164449,1676164450,2023-02-12 01:13:59,,,,,,,

FinancialPlanning,"Hello, I qualify for a VA loan so I can purchase a home with a very low down payment. On the other hand, I have $160k in a brokerage account that I can use for my down payment should I choose to do so. 

I’m confused if I should:

(A) Shop for the best interest rate, and use my brokerage account (lump sum transfer) to put enough money down so that my total monthly mortgage (i.e., PITI) is less than 25% of my gross take home. Due to property taxes in TX, it looks like I would need to sell ~$100k of the $160k to achieve a monthly mortgage payment of &lt;$1620. 

(B) Use a VA loan with a minimal down payment and transfer the difference of more than 25% of my take home from my brokerage each month to pay off the mortgage.

C) Neither. Do _______ instead. 


I make $77,792 gross plus I have a company car that I can use for personal use. I currently have zero debt, and I am looking at buying a home in DFW, TX with a price range of no more than $300k.

FinancialPlanning,"Bank saving account is so low. HYSA is better, but it still take a 1-3 business to clear for transfer. With spending to credit card limit being is 1:25 ratio and cash advance 1:4 ratio, would that be save enough to invest the saving money in market money for +4% or even invest everything in ETF. since all bills are 30 days grace period, it's more than enough time to liquidate in case of a actual emergency.

I currently have a huge chunk of money just wasting away in a normal BoA savings account. I want to open a HSA (in addition to investing another chunk in vanguard). I also want a new credit card to put a lot of upcoming bills/travel on to build points + credit.

I was thinking it'd be easier to just have the same account/bank for the a HSA and a credit card. I was looking at AMEX for their platinum card and their HSA, but I am open to chase/another credit card combo.

Is it wise to have those two in the same bank? Or just maximize each in separate places?

Do y'all have recommendations for credit cards (AMEX vs Chase Freedom etc)?

FinancialPlanning,"
I have a brokerage account with maybe $3.3K in Vanguard’s VGSTX, an actively managed fund. My dad invested my money in high school for me in this fund. Rate of return for past 10 years (about when I started investing in it) 9.09% with an expense ratio of .31%.

I’ve never really had to pay much taxes until this year on it, and it ended up having $181.52 in capital gain distributions. Total $242 dividends &amp; distributions. 

Do I sell out of this or just keep it in there long term? I know last year was a bad year and maybe that’s why I owed more taxes on it for the first time. But the expense ratio is also pretty high. I’m not sure if it’s worse to sell all my holdings in it and incur a large taxable event or just keep it in there and invest in other things. 

I also have $2k just sitting in cash in there. I’m not sure what to invest it in. 

Would love any advice! Should I look into I-bonds? Or should I just buy more Index ETFs, like VUG, VOE, VBR, VWO and VEA like I have in other tax-advantaged accounts.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi All,

I’m planning on relocating this year from the east coast to Nashville. I’m 30 and she’s retiring next month. We currently live together in a house that’s paid off. She’s a single mom and I’m an only child so we’d like to be close with her getting older. 

I’d like to move to Nashville by end of this year. She would stay behind for 6 months to a year but would eventually join. I’d like to own my own home/condo but anything I like is $400-475k. 

I suggested she buys her home in Nashville with equity on the house she has now. I could live in that house and pay half her mortgage until she sells the house we currently live in. The houses she likes in Nashville area are $100-150k more than what she would sell our current home for. I could stay in the Nashville house for a year or two. 

I have some savings and stock for a down payment of my own but I’d like to save more and knock out some minimal student loan debt. However, I’d like to begin my life in a new area sooner than later. I don’t want to move and change cities when I’m 35 or 40. Id like for the move to take place this year.

FinancialPlanning,"I have some friends and colleagues who recently got electric cars, and it got me wondering if I should make an upgrade too, and I'm trying to see if it financially makes sense and would be worth it because it looks like monthly loan payments would cost less than my car payments + gas. So far I am looking at the Chevy Bolt EV or EUV and Hyundai Ioniq 5 (I love how Polestar 2 looks but it'd be too expensive, same for Teslas too). I'm listing down the info below to make it straightforward and easier to read:

About me:

* 21 years old
* 100k salary + upcoming bonus, my monthly take-home pay is around $5500 after taxes/benefits/401k
* I currently live with my parents, so my expenses are food, gas, chipping in for groceries/house expenses, personal spending, flight training (hopefully ending soon; the exam is coming up)

My current car and commute/driving info:

* 2019 Camry at ~55k miles
   * $290 monthly payments (until May 2027, it was leased and we financed it)
   * Remaining debt: $14790, payoff quote as of today: $13500, current trade-in value: ~$16000
   * Fuel expenses: $130/mo (the tank usually fills for $45 and I usually buy gas two or three times per month)
   * Upcoming expenses: oil change in 3 months, front tire replacement sometime later this year, general inspection/maintenance (used to be free when it was leased)
* Monthly driving info:
   * Commute: ~720 miles (~45 miles away, two days per week)
   * Taking my sister to tutoring, school/extracurricular activities: ~200 miles
   * Local driving (driving for flight training, Target/Shoprite/mall, visiting friends, etc.): ~200 miles
   * Random local road trip (usually once a month): ~100 miles

My calculations:

* Monthly car expenses: $420 + oil change and other maintenance
* ""Profit"" from paying off and selling the car: $2500, so not underwater/upside down on the loan
* Chevy Bolt EUV ($32k at local dealers) with trade in, 60-month loan: $400/month

So if my calculations are correct, my monthly payments for an EV car would be less than what I’m paying and EVs don’t have other expenses such as oil change, engine maintenance, etc. There are charging stations at my office’s parking deck, many nearby, and even the possibility of charging at home.

FinancialPlanning,"My understanding is if I make a contribution to my traditional IRA, and I'm not eligible for a deduction, I will still have to pay taxes on not just the gains (expected) but also the contribution amount upon withdrawal.

Because if I did this I'd be paying taxes on the 6k contribution amount twice right? It's post-tax money already and I'm ineligible for deduction, and it's taxed again after IRA withdrawal.

FinancialPlanning,"Hi,
Long story short:

-2 years ago I was financially illiterate 
-I found a financial advisor who sold me a life insurance policy so that I could opt out of WA's long term care tax.
-he implied the tax would be a lot, but in reality it's 30 a month
-he implied that the life insurance account would pay out a huge multiple later in life, but recently it was just 5% year over year
-this policy costs me 150 a month

Here's the rub- he sold me this policy in early 2019. You could not opt out of state coverage until 2020.

He never ever, even once reminded me to opt out of the state program, as he told me he would.
( he failed to add me to his info email and I got no notifications)

So basically, I've spent 3200 over the last two years to leverage opting out of mandatory state long term care tax, but I didn't opt out, so now it's just a life insurance policy.


I feel majorly ripped off, am I being ridiculous?


Do I have any recourse or do I just take my lumps and move on?

FinancialPlanning,"Hello, I currently have my 403b set to 33% FGKFX (Fidelity Growth Company K6 Fund), 33% DBMYX (Bny Mellon Small Mid cap Growth, 33% HNACX (harbor capital appreciation fund retirement class), and 1% FXAIX (fidelity 500 index fund -tracks s&amp;p). 

My age is 37 and I make ~200k, but base is 155k. 

I joined my current employer in 2020 so all of these funds are down from the last year. -8% on FGKFX, -22% on DBMYX, and -22% on HNACX. 

FGKFX ER =.45%
FXAIX ER =.015%
DBMYX = .63%
HNACX = .63%

I contribute the max 20k to my retirement each year and my employer contributes 15k, so 35k total. 

Should I keep the allocations the same so that Im buying these funds while they are down and they’ll eventually recover or should I reallocate now and go with larger contributions elsewhere. Im thinking maybe 30% FXAIX, 20% FGKFX, 30% VIGIX, and 20% a target retirement fund. 

VIGIX ER = .04%
VTTSX ER (2060 retirement fund) = .08%

It seems like HNACX and DBMYX  are not rated as well by morningstar but Im not sure if I should stick with them or abandon them now. Their longterm returns seem to be decent, although the last night 5 years are not good for HNACX. 

Also, if I shift DBMYX and HNACX arent I losing out on money since those two are down quite a bit? Could use some guidance.

My brother is trying to move closer to me and my mom. The tldr is that he asked if I could help him out financially (so his family can afford the higher cost of homes here). He would put my name as co-owner of the house. He’ll live in the home with his family, and sell in 15 years after their son goes to college. He’ll take care of paying all property taxes, home maintenance, etc. 

I’m not good with finance stuff like this. What are the risks and watch outs of this arrangement, and since I really do want to help him, how should I structure the arrangement to protect myself? 

He is married with a wife and two kids. I am married with a baby. My husband is supportive of helping my brother.

FinancialPlanning,"I’m 22 and I’m in thousands of dollars of debt. ($7,000-$8,000) Since I was 16 my parents got me a debit card and essentially asked me to earn everything. They gave me a roof to live under and food to eat and I appreciate them so much for that. From that moment I bought my own car and my own insurance plan. Moved out at 18 attempted college and lived on my own. I’ve since then lived on my own but have been evicted twice. First time during Covid while in college working at a restaurant (which closed due to Covid).  Second time due to me being financially ignorant. Not saving properly. 

I had heart surgery that wasn’t covered by insurance and they haven’t come for me yet about the cost of that, though I know it will happen one day. 

Ive filed my own taxes since I was 16 and I managed to not file the past two years. Just again me not really having a grip on life. I had some low times and that’s no excuse, but it sure made it hard to be productive. 

My student loans are now due, asking for payments. 

My most recent mess up is not receiving toll charges to the right address. So all the visits I make to see my girlfriend (NC -&gt; PA) have added up hundreds of dollars in tolls. 

I make decent money now but the problem is the cost of living has made paying for my past mistakes so incredibly hard. 

I KNOW it’s all my fault and there’s no doubt about that. I’ve dug this hole and the only way out is to work for it and I’m more than willing. I would just love to get some perspectives from people who’ve dealt with or know people who have this problem.

Finances are not my cup of tea, so I’m not of much assistance to this person, but I know that Reddit can come in clutch at times.

Did I do something wrong? 
Should I contract Empower customer service to confirm if it got in the right account?
How long would it take take to appear in my Fidelity account?

I have a feeling putting in taxes money would be best for me but not hundred percent sure... also how much money does the acct make if you max it out? And when do you have to max it out by?

FinancialPlanning,"Basically, my main priority is to build a retirement fund. But I have other financial goals such as saving for an addition onto my house, emergency funds for medical and vet bills and emergency for loss of employment or natural disaster. 

I need a place where I can do it all and manage my money in one spot. I don't want to rely on an employer to provide a 401k (because previous employer screwed us over before) and my husband wants a Roth Ira so we don't have to worry about tax when we take out our money when we need it. 

I've looked into SoFi, but what keeps me from starting an account with them is how they aren't FDIC insured and there is no guarantee that my money will still be there if they ever go under as a company. My bank doesn't have any options, as they are a small town credit union and I'm not interested in having to move money over into a different bank that isn't anywhere near us. We live in a very rural part of the US. 

I also wanna add that the less financial lingo the better -  I am not savvy in that arena at all.

FinancialPlanning,"Financial Picture
Mid 30s and would like early retirement if possible (50-55). More importantly, I want to make sure we are on the right track to retire in general. 

Currently I make around 83k and wife makes 46k. 2 IRAS at $133k and 20k. 1 Roth around 13k. Taxable brokerage is around 24k. 529 for child at 5.5k and brokerage account for child at $1.2k. One fully funded pension and another pension that is contributed to directly.  

Main issue: we don’t have much cash. We have roughly 3-5k in cash. 

How would you prioritize saving cash versus investing if you were in this situation? Would you guys pay off the student loan sooner or try to conserve more money towards an emergency fund?  

How much cash do you think is a reasonable amount with the level of expenses we have? For reference, we have around $4k in expenses per month across the board. 

Is early retirement even possible?

FinancialPlanning,"Without giving out too many details, I would love to hear any of your input whether I should pay off my mortgage right now, or invest the money I have. From what I’ve learned, the market might be a bit shaky this year, especially with the looming prospect the U.S. could default if the debt ceiling is not increased, therefore impacting the stock market. So investing now would potentially result in a loss. 

My current mortgage remaining is $50k with an interest rate of 4.5%; monthly payment of $520 excluding HOA. I have been saving up this past year to reach my goal of having $70k total in savings, idea being $50k to pay off mortgage and $20k remaining for a 6 month buffer in case I lost my job.

My thought process is if the market looks a bit rough ahead, pay the mortgage off now guaranteeing a 4.5% ROI, have an extra $520 a month I can then pump a portion into a 401k (decent match by employer) as well as additional investments within the market, and also have some additional savings to travel (something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time).

FinancialPlanning,"This is a question related to qualified retirement plans like 401k's or 403b's. What exactly is the benefit of tax deferral? Is it just that you hope to be in a lower tax bracket later once you retire, and the savings is based on the difference between your tax bracket now and your tax bracket later?

I see this argument in online articles all the time that by deferring taxes, you have a larger pot of money to compound. I'm confused by this because if your tax bracket is the same now vs later, you still end up with the exact same amount of money whether you pay taxes now or later, right? On top of this is the fact that the gains in retirement accounts are all taxed as income vs as capital gains, so could you actually end up paying MORE in tax on your retirement assets than if you had just put them in a regular taxable account?

Relatedly, what would ever be the point of using a Roth retirement account?

FinancialPlanning,"Hello everyone, I’m 23 years old &amp; this is my first year with a full time job (graduated college last year). My job has a pension plan (can’t opt out) where they will pay you a maximum 80% of your highest salary (depends on the years of service/age of retirement/etc) after you retire until you die. There’s no cap to it &amp; it also gets adjusted for inflation. 
My plan is to try to max out my Roth IRA this year &amp; every year after that. 
But my question is, should I also be investing into a 401k with my employer or on my own? If so how much? They do not offer a match since they have the pension. 
I’m also setting aside for an emergency fund &amp; down the road a down payment on a started house or condo. If I do a 401k i would not contribute as much to my down payment savings. 

I’m making $77k, living at home. 
Paycheck after taxes/pension/benefits/etc: $2100ish biweekly

We will always max our ROTH IRA as well as my wife 401k. Im planning to only do 15% for my 401k because im thinking of investing in taxable account for paying off the house or supplement our early retirement.

My wife made $113k gross; I made $92k gross. We get 2x increase annually but hers is higher than me because she works in the hospital. Both of us can do a lot of OT if our schedule allows us but we have a kid at home. We dont send her to daycare, we just alternate our schedule to be able to take care of our daughter.

QUESTIONS: 
1. Are the Allocation of our Portfolio good enough until we retire?we'll switch slowly to bonds til we get closer to retirement. I dont exacly know when, how to rebalance our portfolio in the future. Not sure if it is needed. Planning to open taxable account VTI 60%, VXUS 40% planning to use this to pay for our house after 10 to 20 years or perhaps supplement our goal to retire early.

2. Do you think we can retire in our 50's? I'm planning to open a taxable account to supplement our early retirement. How much do i need in order to do that? Im planning to leave my 401k at 15% in order for me to invest in taxable account. I know tax advantaged accounts are better because it greatly reduce your tax in the future.

BB3. Is it ok to open taxable account then let it grow and use it to pay for our house? I have chronic illness so i just want to make sure my wife and my daughter will have a paid for house if ever things goes south for me. Also our health insurance especially for me, how are we going to have health insurance if we plan to retire early? 

4. What is our current Tax Income Bracket? Do we also need to file taxes in our Retirement accounts? For Taxable account do we also need to file tax or if we just sell?  Im sorry, i know I sucked at math.

FinancialPlanning,"grand plan, thoughts please

So. I've posted a few times over the last few months here and personal finance and first time home buyer. I think I finally have my grand plan + direction for about 24-48 straight months if nothing changes for my wife and I, or at least nothing drastic. 
1. Pay off taxes around 4k in March. 
2. Pay off wife's car loan of 4500 in May
3. Summer/vacation planning for stuff ~around 2k (3 bachelor parties + weddings for three best friends between May-October)
4. ~14 months from now pay off consolidation loan #1 ~9k 
5. ~28 months from now Pay off consolidation loan #2 ~21k
6. Grow emergency savings from ~2 months to 6 months. 
7. Save for first time home buyers down payment. Looking to save in two parts. 10k for closing costs/extras and about 25k-35k for a down payment for a 220-250k house. (Currently around 16k saved for both these things (majority in a CD) for both e-savings and down-payment stuff. 

I have several differented allocated accounts to cover bases, investing, and overall saving that I will continue but pause the bigger amounts. Basically think Dave Ramsey 'ish because I will always continue to invest while paying off stuff. Next thing to tackle after buying a house will be both mine and my wife's student loans. But I'm happy to say I do not have any CC debt after consolidation, no car payment, no medical bills, and rent is cheap so we are able to accelerate/avalanche the savings/debt pay off. I've mapped out majority of the bills/budget so I think once I pay off her car loan then she will be able to pay off student loans quicker or pay for her schooling that she's in right now. 

In 36-48 months my goal is to be able to have 30-40k for the first house + 18-20k as an e fund.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello,  i am a student in Europe, through very unfortunate circumstances i will  be inheriting some money,  equivalent to almost a million dollars.

* Ive been living a normal lower middle class life, havent ever had any real amount of money in my hands. 
* I understand the basic  personal finance, budgeting and being frugal. 
* Im into finance as a whole and follow business people and investors online
* Im in Europe, i will graduate in 1,5 years and will most likely go to university, not that i want to study but the benefits i will get as a student are crazy
* I want to build generational wealth and have complete financial freedom before im 25

I came here to seek advice, i have very little real life experiences, and frankly no clue what to do first.

* If you were in my boots, what would you do?
* Should i leave money in the bank? How liquid should i stay?
* Best ROI investments to live off of until i figure everything out (living cost is very small)?
* What should i expect from my family and friends? Should i even tell my friends?
* How to deal with family expectations of me giving them money, without breaking relationships?
* How do i maximize this opportunity, do i invest most of the money, do i try starting businesses?
* What mistakes did you make in your finance life and how can i avoid them?
* Anything in particular i should educate myself on, any good books?",t2_cfhkoguk,0,"18 years old, 1 million dollars, advice?",[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,10uojxl,True,researchthrowawa,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10uojxl/18_years_old_1_million_dollars_advice/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10uojxl/18_years_old_1_million_dollars_advice/,527488,1675633665,0,,False,1675633676,1675633677,2023-02-05 21:47:45,,,,,,,

My SO and I are planning out what we will be able to afford for a our fist and primary residence. From what I’ve learned so far, you can estimate what you can afford by doing a pre qualification app. Is the primary way or are there other ways?

I see so many people on here in such great financial shape that I worry if I’m screwed. 49(m) married with 18 year old in college and 15 year old in high school. I earn $100k as a teacher that will pay me 80% of my highest three years starting at 57. (It’s actually closer to 90% as I’ll no longer have to pay 11% into the pension system. Though I will ultimately probably have to take less than 80% so my wife would have survivor benefits) I have a 403b with $60k and an IRA with $16k. About $7k in cc debt and 1 car loan with $15k balance. House worth about $530k and owe $140k. I also have side hustle that pays about $40k year and wife earns about $25k but basically nothing for retirement other than ss I guess. I plan to expand my side hustle when I retire which could bump income to $60k from that or perhaps seek a full-time job in the private sector or potentially another job in education in a neighboring state as once you collect pension you are limited to what you can earn in current state.

FinancialPlanning,"Looking for advice on how to utilize a lump sum of cash to get into a better financial position.

The background: My husband and I are starting on our debt free journey and need your help to settle a debate on what to do with some money we will get from the sale of a pop up camper that we own outright. We have lived frivolously (carelessly) for years, and even though we make enough money to live comfortably and debt-free, we find ourselves with 40k in high interest credit card debt. A lot of this is from a recent home renovation which went way over budget, so we have added equity to our house (second bathroom). Anyway, we've started using YNAB (You Need a Budget) and are hoping to crush the credit card debt and start saving for our family's future. We've agreed to the avalanche method and have already had success tightening our budget and having money each month to put toward our highest interest card.

THE DEBATE: There are two things at play here - a pop up camper that is paid in full and an auto loan on a vehicle we can't afford. We have agreed to sell our pop up camper which we don't use as much as we thought we would, to help us get into a better financial position. What should we do with the proceeds of this sale?

The camper: Agreed to part with this asset, it should sell for appx $12,500

The vehicle: We owe $32,000 and it's currently worth less than that, maybe $28,000 (ouch). We've agreed that we should get out of this car and into something with better mileage and less cost to own. We agree we would be comfortable with a vehicle we could get for about $10,000 (wish we realized this a year ago when we financed the luxury car).

SHOULD WE:

Use the funds from the camper sale to pay down our highest interest credit card (7k at 30% and 5k at 27%). Then, trade in our vehicle at a dealership and get into a lower car payment each month. PRO: We've paid off our highest interest card and half of our second highest interest card - a huge win for Cc debt payoff journey. CON: We are paying dealer fees and not getting as much for our car as we could on a private sale. Also, we'll still have a car payment.

Use the funds from the camper sale to buy a car from a private seller. Sell our car and pay out of pocket the difference we owe on the loan to value. PRO: We don't have a car payment, we make Dave Ramsey fans very happy. We own this asset outright and we've paid no dealer fees and gotten more for our current vehicle selling private party. CON: We haven't put a huge chunk toward our highest interest debt and the 40k is still looming.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debts:**

* Housing (including mortgage/HOA/utilities) \~1550/month. I paid my mortgage until May 2023. Any purpose in paying it earlier to my principal? My interest rate is 3 percent FWIW.
* Cell phone: 75/month (cheapest I could find for 3 lines)
* Credit cards: I can't give a rough estimate but, this is used for groceries, entertainment, gas, etc. I owe like $1000 right now on it.
* Cant think of anything else other than the usual property tax, insurance that would be due at a certain time,etc....

&amp;#x200B;

**Assets/Savings:**

* Discover high yield savings (3.3 percent interest): 69K saved

&amp;#x200B;

* Empower 401K (this is from my previous full-time job that I am now per diem with): \~20K. **I am not sure if I should transfer this? is it better to keep it here or another company?**

* Fidelity Roth IRA: \~1500k in the account. **I honestly have no idea what truly I'm doing with this account other than going by the general consensus here to ""buy"" FZROX, FZILZ, FXNAX,etc. I just been putting 50-100 in each portfolio, if I remember. I would like to improve in this area. I contributed $1076 in 2022 and $250 as of this year. So  not sure where the rest came from, unless thats in the money market.**

&amp;#x200B;

* (NEW) Charles Schwab 401K.  Through my new job. I am contributing 7 percent of my paycheck . **The rep told me my employer will match 125 percent and up to 6 percent. Not sure what this means. Is this good? The rep told me she was jealous. Should I contribute more?** P.S., I got soo lucky because they made a new policy where employees won't be matched until a year of employment. This was for  employees hired 1/1/23. I got hired 12/19/22.

 

* (NEW) HSA account. This was recently made through my new employer. I believe I am aiming to contribute a high amount. - like 2800? **Should I increase this?** 

&amp;#x200B;

* Credit Card miles/points/CB: ok not sure if this counts lol. But I have about $4k worth of points/miles/CB. Due to noninvestment purposes, I'll put this aside. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My income:**

* I'm a social worker, since getting my MSW 3 years ago. I'm not sure if my salary will go up but I am working three jobs now, so technically in a sense, it has gone up
* Full time job: \~61K/ year
* Per diem gig remote: i work an average of 15 hours per week, 34/hr. I think I made the mistake of switching to 1099. Not sure if I should talk to my boss again and go back to W2. But I dont think I can.
* Per diem hospital: unsure of the hours as of this time, but hopefully i will work one weekend day every other weekend. 30/hr. but who knows, maybe ill work more/ less. I am welcome to pick up more as needed

&amp;#x200B;

**How I consolidate/plan:**

I just pay the bills by ""prioritization"" otherwise, i just send the remaining of my paycheck to my Discover account. I act like I'm living below my means. 

I plan on becoming licensed (hopefully I pass my upcoming exam!) and taking a few more certifications to be more marketable in case management.

FinancialPlanning,"Hello and thank you for your advice! 

My financial advisor has suggested that purchasing whole life insurance would be a financially good idea for my husband and I. I have always thought that it would be better to invest our money then purchase whole life insurance. 

Here are our financial details: 

We are both 46. 

I am a teacher and have a pension in which I will get 70% of my highest income when I retire. I will not get social security. 

We have $375,000 in retirement savings. My husband will get social security and we will draw from our retirement savings once we retire. We own our home and will pay it off in 20 years. 

These were the points she made when she was trying to convince us that whole life insurance would be a good idea: 

1) She suggesting getting insurance that would provide a $500,000 death benefit for our son. 

2) She said you can draw money out of your whole life insurance for emergencies, and then pay it back, without affecting the final death benefit. 

3) She explained that if you invest with the purpose of leaving an inheritance, and then need to draw on the investments for an emergency, it can significantly affect the final balance of the investments even if you pay it back. For instance if you draw on your investments, and then the market does poorly, there can be dramatic negative repercussions in your final balance. 

I listen to a lot of financial podcasts, and I have never heard the podcasters say that whole life insurance was the best way to create an inheritance for your children or others. Aren't the insurance companies just making money at your expense with whole life insurance? I worry that she is suggesting whole life insurance because she'll get a commission with the sale.

FinancialPlanning,"I live on an island in Greece and, at 26 yo, I did not expect to still be living with my parents. I stayed here because of the pandemic and my life ended up being quite comfortable, although a little bit dull.

For the past three or so years, I have been lucky enough to escape the standard career path of most of my peers, who are earning maybe 700-1000 euros per month. I work remotely for a US company, and even though the pay is low for them it is huge for Greek standards, and even though I am tired of the job I have saved up around 60k, given that my living expenses are almost nonexistent. 

Now the thing is. My family has always been relatively poor. My mum’s a teacher and my dad is a construction worker. My dad has always built villas for other people who had the capital to benefit from tourism, which is the #1 “industry” here.

I own a piece of land in one of the dreamiest places for villas, and that plot is actually surrounded by luxurious homes with pools. My dad is relatively old, he will be 60 soon, and we had the idea of starting to build a villa ourselves to have a stable source of income. My dad can’t keep doing this physically demanding job for too many years to come, and retirement will be extremely minimal, given the state of my country. 

The “market price” for the villa I have in mind would be over 150k. This would be less for us, considering my dad’s been in the industry and can build a lot of the things himself and knows people.

 

The issue is that this project really IS doable, but at what cost? 

I would have to spend all of my savings and then either get a loan, or delay completion. 

I don't want to commit to living with my parents for the next two or three years just to finish this project, I already feel that I have overstayed my welcome at this place. I always dreamed of living abroad. I have a very fuzzy idea of what I want my life to look like in the future, but figuring that out probably requires travel and money. I stayed here because of the pandemic and I did not imagine to still be here after all this time. I don't feel a particular rush to move, but I am afraid of getting stuck here for the long-term. 

It is comfortable to earn what I earn as a writer, but I feel I would also like to explore other career paths. Essentially I am very unsure about what to do with my life right now.  it would not make sense to get up and leave while still committing to spending thousands on a big project like that at the same time, right?

Ideally, I would get started on this project later. But my dad may not be able to help out with this 5 years down the line. I feel very pressured. Would I be passing up on a huge opportunity if I don’t get this started? Or will I find myself shackled by financial obligations and unable to change my life if things go south?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I am a 26yo still living in my hometown and wanting to go out and life life at some point, but what if I should dump all my savings to build a villa to secure some level of financial independence for my family for the years to come?",t2_2mzgpw7a,0,Faced with major financial decision at 26 yo - build a house or go live life?,[],r/FinancialPlanning,False,6,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6,,text,self.FinancialPlanning,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2qwze,,10titfs,True,Arrwsthmenh,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10titfs/faced_with_major_financial_decision_at_26_yo/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/10titfs/faced_with_major_financial_decision_at_26_yo/,526582,1675523977,0,,False,1675523988,1675523989,2023-02-04 15:19:37,,,,,,,
