Lived in the same Midwest suburb for the last 23 years. We've lived 15 years in this house and it will be paid off in 2. Paid $240k for it new in 2008 (before housing crash). It's worth about $400k now. No other debt.

retirement,"Okay, so this may seem like a silly question, but consider me completely uninformed regarding retirement and cash flow.  I will provide a little bit of my situation for context.  I am 52 and married.  The wife is 52 as well.  I have a retirement plan at work and I contribute the maximum allowed and my employer matches up to 6%.  Current balance is about 500k and the calculators I've used suggest I should have around 2 million at 65.  I am eligible for social security as well (about 3300 if I start at 67, or 2800 if at 65).

The wife has a pension (she is a teacher) that will pay her a little over 3k if she retired today.  At the end of the year she will be fully vested and also qualify for lifetime health insurance for the both of us (for her life, not mine).  She also has a retirement plan with about 65k and started maxing it about six months ago.  No matching.  Finally, we live in southern CA and how will be paid off in 2035 (when we both turn 65).

Anyway, here is dumb question.  Assuming we have well over 2 million in our retirement plans, how does cash flow actually work (especially if I delay social security)?  I mean, I get that we can purchase an annuity, though I imagine the return is smaller and perhaps not the wisest choice if we also want to leave something for the kids.  

But what about keeping the money invested in stocks?  I understand the idea of dividends but am not sure how that works re: cash flow.  And what happens when the market is down?  Like, over the past year my portfolio is down 6%.  What happens cash flow wise then?

Looking at ~$125 / 145 per hr (W2/1099). Already worked almost 4 months at substantially less (W2) with accelerated Roth 401k contributions (almost half limit contributed). Job would be ending and wanted all the Roth I could get. 

W2 includes health ins (basic is free / not spouse). 401k match (4% match). Low value life ins / AD&amp;D. Couple others - minor. 

I’d be starting from scratch if 1099. Do I need an LLC or is sole proprietorship ok? Health insurance options (marketplace?) Wife’s Medicare starting Oct - I’m 1.5 years away. 

Wife kinda negative on 1099. Need accountant. Complex. But talked to financial guy. He says 1099. But admits I’m already carrying a lot of deferred comp from decades of trad 401k. But with recent mandatory withdrawals delayed - he’s ok. 

Also not sure what headache I’m getting into. Start in 8 business days - need to do quickly.

This contract is a year min. But I think it’s good chance just a year. So next year 4 months and rest might be retirement. So deferral not such an issue then.🤔

My instinct is to invest it in a high yield CD while interest rates are high and put some in a HY savings account, as well as a mix of some treasuries/TIPS/I-bonds. They’ll need to access (some) of the money in the next couple years so want to stay away from longer-dated securities.

retirement,"I've spoken to SS customer service 2x and got 2 different answers plus they are answering my questions with answers that are not relevant to what I am trying to figure out. I don't know if I am the issue or they are, maybe someone can help me here. 

So my dad's retirement age is 66 and 2 months. He is now 68 and 1 month. He did not start his benefits at retirement age because he was still working. At 67 and 8 months, he was laid off and since he hasn't been able to find anything else he has decided to apply for retirement. 

When filling out the application it says you can select to get benefits retroactively 6 months. 

I am trying to figure out what were his benefits 6 months prior to today and if it is worth applying for? There are no historical statements or records on the website to see what his prior benefits were. When I called SS the first person said he can apply up to 6 months prior to today and it WONT affect his benefit amount. The next person said he should apply only starting january of 2023, otherwise his benefits WILL be affected. 

Because he waited from the age of 66 to 68, he gets the delayed retirement credit. So if we were to apply retroactively to September 2022 instead of March 2023, wouldn't we go back to what his benefits were as of September 2022 and going forward indefinitely his benefits would be based off of September 2022 instead of March 2023. 

The delayed retirement credit for the years of 2022 gets applied to the benefits as of January 2023. So if we retroactively go to September.. don't we lose out on the credit from September 2022 - December 2022? What scenario would it be worth collecting the benefits retroactively?

retirement,"Like a well-behaved, good-tempered infant, I adore mornings. I rise at dawn, eagerly make coffee, write essays, and listen to music. This morning, Mr. Chow, a jazz-pop song by Acoustic Alchemy, plays in the background. Outside, the harsh cold weather, the kind that distracts you, dissipates. Irregular patches of snow cover the backyard like an expressionist painting. With each year of not working, five and counting, distant memories of workplace drama and pressures - fade to black. Subsequently, scenes of dining with friends, early morning tennis matches, making pizza dough, and taking mid-day naps come into focus. 

Sometimes, I whisper under my breath, shit, this is my real life; I’m not dreaming. The first time I said that it was weirdly validating. My eyes misted; I exhaled slowly, feeling my blood pressure fall. I felt visceral gratitude. Ralph Waldo Emerson described it as vague, indefinite riches. No amount of material wealth buys humility and thankfulness. Since I have occasional archy joints after a challenging workout and poor sleep, I am joyful, almost smug, when I leave the bed and walk downstairs with clarity, comfort, and an erect carriage.

I recently watched a documentary, Stutz, featuring an inviting self-improvement practice -- the concept of life force. Parts of the strategy, like a good diet, exercise, and adequate sleep, are apparent. But the psychological steps of connection with others and introspection fascinate me, so I wanted to investigate.

According to Dr. Stutz, a psychotherapist, life force is your relationship to your physical body, other human beings, and yourself. Becoming your best self is possible when you do these things regularly:

• Eat nutritionally, exercise, and sleep. 
• Invite a friend or relative to lunch. 
• Write in a journal. 

Dr. Stutz believes these practices help you feel better all around. For instance, connection with others is a critical element of personal growth. The person you invite to lunch represents all of humanity. Relationships are like pitons, something you grab ahold for support and safety, as you climb the metaphorical mountain.

Of the three relationship components, the most important one is with yourself. People may think about what they want in life. But they rarely take a disciplined approach to writing down their thoughts. Accordingly, journaling is an effective way to explore what’s on your mind and discover your passions.

Journaling galvanized my desire to play better tennis. Other interests like reading classic books, craft cocktails, entertaining friends, and writing essays emerged. The former led to weekly tennis drills, weight training, cardio, lunches with fellow players, and culminating in the big Saturday morning match. What starts out as a serious competition with tennis balls hit with pace and loud grunts, eventually dissolves into ninety minutes of compliments, laughs, and high-fives. 

It sounds silly at sixty-eight, but I felt a renewed purpose with my tennis pursuits, an excitement for life in general. It wasn’t lost on me that if my retirement hobby were to play tennis at a competitive level, I wouldn’t offset it with a poor diet and lack of sleep. With a laissez-faire attitude, I focused on equal parts, winning, camaraderie, and fun. Not surprisingly, my tennis game improved so did the joy in my life.

As a sexagenarian, I learned something new from adopting Dr. Stutz’s life force practice. It’s called byproduct benefits. When I took one positive action, such as athletic training, several other things materialized - a healthier diet, better sleep, closer tennis friendships, and a more optimistic outlook. All in all, the life force isn’t rocket science, but it sure helped me enjoy my retirement even more. I hope you try it.",t2_qbi5jlqj,0,A MEDITATION ON RETIREMENT,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,11i1c37,True,Haroldchan1,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/11i1c37/a_meditation_on_retirement/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/11i1c37/a_meditation_on_retirement/,19664.0,1677942365,0.0,,False,1677942383,1677942383,2023-03-04 15:06:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"IRS employee nearing retirement with cancer lately. While I was a ""case pusher"" earlier in my career and called on by previous executives for my extreme knowledge in my tiny specialty, for the past 2 years, my skills, Training, promotion, development have been ignored.

So I am working less than with extreme dedication. The opposite of which I did for the first 17 years. I am planning to retire in 8 months. I am posting this here since I know there are plenty of former fed employees up here.

Is there anything management can do to torture me for my last 8 months? You know, fire me, take away my pension, assign me to a pod in another state, demote me?

I also have been working on a personal project for the past 4 years. Ethics counsel was informed and thought it was ok.

I have heard many good things about Valencia, such as its beautiful beaches, mild weather, and rich culture. However, I am wondering if it would be a good place for me to retire. Can anyone share their experience living in Valencia or in Spain in general?

Also, I am curious about the cost of living in Valencia and if it is affordable for retirees. What are the housing prices like? Are there any healthcare facilities nearby that I can access easily?

retirement,"I can't believe I left a golden handcuffs job. I worked in IT as a Software developer and project manager for 25 years in the state government. I've been wanting to quit the field entirely for at least the last 6-7 years, but I convinced myself to stay. It just got to the point where I was extremely miserable in my job and loathed working in an office. I had many hobbies over the years and I've travelled all over the world. I consider myself to be an adventurous individual. I wanted to do something completely different but at the time I didn't know what else I wanted to do career wise.

There were several family deaths in my family over the last few years  including a young child which contributed to me leaving my job. I decided to retire early at the age of 47 and take a year off from working. I receive a health insurance and a pension which pays all of my bills. I have a home and rental property which are both paid off. I have zero debt and no children. I have only about 100k in a retirement fund.

I decided to go back to school for nursing as a 2nd career. I only plan on working per diem and/or contracts for 7-9 months a year and taking off 3-5 months. I planned to invest my nursing salary to help build up my retirement funds and work until I'm 60-62. I don't plan to pull from social security until I'm 70.

I get these thoughts that pop up in my head everyday that I wake up since I retired letting me know I made a huge mistake. That if I would have stayed at my job I could be done working at 56 and I wouldn't have to put in effort into a 2nd career.

retirement,"I have several medical conditions that are eligible for consideration for disability.  I did read that its easier to be approved for disability in your 60's and sometimes its worth looking into rather than choosing to retire early and take less benefits.  One of the criteria is if this condition will keep you from working within the next 12 months.  I am still working part time, but my most recent diagnosis does cause some symptoms like headaches and fatigue, which I already am experiencing, other symptoms could come up later as it progresses.  I just wondered how feasible it is to apply for disability, as opposed to retiring early and losing out on the money.  I plan on continuing to work because we need that income.  I never thought I would ever be considering disability payments, but financially speaking, I wonder if its worth looking into in case such time comes that I really cannot work as much as I need to.

retirement,"I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today.  He discussed, for example how the S&amp;P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants:  Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla.  These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&amp;P 500.  

Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors.  And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time.  As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&amp;P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.  

Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this?  I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&amp;P by 1.5% to 2% annually.  

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this.  Anyone have a portfolio like this?  Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically?

retirement,"I am a white collar western office worker in my beast years (40). With 2 degrees and 17 years of expertise I am reaping the rewards of hard and consistent work with good remuneration and a very promising future retirement to survive on. 
But the question is: where is the best place to retire? Vietnam, Thailand or Spain and why? Or anywhere else? 

My thoughts are the following having met dozens expats, retired and professionals worldwide: 

Spain
Pros: good climate, ok food (not super fantastic though), easy to travel in Europe (but expensive as retired). 
Cons: more expensive than Thailand and Vietnam. Colder winter than in south Vietnam and Thailand. Problems with illegal immigrants pouring into Europe. 

Thailand 
Pros: nice weather, friendly locals (on average), low cost living, good food. Easy to arrange with Visa. Tourism is a developed sector. 
Cons: too much of sexpats, trashy backpackers and people with low to zero moral standards suddenly walking around thinking they are kings while in the west nobody wants to deal with them. Tired to see +65y with +20 poor dolls. Too many dodgy foreigners at the low end of society. But perhaps Huahin is better than Pattaya as retired. Too many marijuana/cannabis shops making people's brain  🧠 crazy. Check research to understand the impacts of smoking this crap. 

Vietnam 
Pros: genuine authentic people. Easier to make friends with the Vietnamese. Good weather in south Vietnam, good food (but not as good as in Thailand). Low cost of living if you stay away from Saigon but you may have to accept lower standard of life. 
Cons: pollution, dirty streets, some really dirty beaches, visa hassle, corruption, underdeveloped, no real public transportation.

retirement,"Hi all, 

Here is a business idea. 

One problem we have heard retirees say repeatedly is that you have waited for your whole working career to travel, but now that this time has arrived, you can't because of your pets. You love your pet but crave your freedom. So what do you do?

Pet boarding is too expensive if you are going on a trip longer than a few days. 

Online pet-sitting apps- You don't know who these people really are or if they will care for your pet correctly.

Friends and Family- You might not have a network you feel comfortable asking this big favor, and if you do- it is still a big commitment especially if you plan on taking that extended trip. 

Solution: Therapy Paws. A company that partners with you to give your pet specialized therapy training. Then when you are gone, we partner you with a local health facility (hospital, assisted living facility ect.) that has trained employees who will both take care of your dog and use the dog in the rehabilitation/treatment of the facility's residents. This will allow you to get training and boarding at an affordable price and give you the comfort and peace of mind knowing your pet is doing important work while you are away.

retirement,"So I posted a few days ago about retiring at 63 yrs old.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/117hr3z/am\_i\_crazy\_to\_be\_thinking\_about\_retirement\_age\_63/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/117hr3z/am_i_crazy_to_be_thinking_about_retirement_age_63/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Well, I just got some medical dx that pretty much confirms I most likely will not live to be in my 90's.  Doc said most people with this condition live 17-20 years, that would put me at 83 yrs old.  However, I am overweight and have not been great with my diet, but I never smoked, never did drugs, and I do walk for exercise 30 minutes about 5x a week.  With any luck I can live into my early 80s God willing.  But there is a big likelihood of possibly going in my 70's (mom died at 53, dad died at 78).  Would this kind of information cause you to think about taking SS earlier rather than later?  Retire and just live the good life?  I do work part time, from home with a very flexible schedule, but I am pretty much bored with the work. I find it more like drudgery when I do it, but I do it because we need the money to pay the bills.  Hubs is already retired for a few years now.  We have about $400K in retirement accounts. Our expenses are not horrible, thankfully no debt except a car that is almost paid off and a mortgage, unfortunately (its not a huge mortgage, in fact the dang insurance and taxes every month are higher than the principle and interest!).

retirement,"I'm amazed not to have read the following anywhere while planning retirement, so I thought I'd alert others to how delayed credits work. I know it's no use to rant against the system, but there's no place else to scream where anyone will listen. So please excuse the rant - it feels good to be able to do it somewhere.

As you all know, your benefit is increased by 1/12 of 8% (2/3%) for each month you delay retirement past full retirement age. What they don't tell you clearly is that the increase in benefits won't start till the January after retirement. 

For example, if on January 1 of this year I have 19 delayed credits, then choose to retire in July, I have a total of 25 delayed credits  and my benefit will increase an amount totaling 25 * 2/3% = 16 67%. However. My initial benefit payments (July through December) will only include 19 credits, or a 12.67% increase.

Starting in January, they'll recalc the benefit using 16 67% (which now includes the extra credits), but the government won't retroactively adjust the six months of benefits that were calculated at the reduced 12.67% amount.


**Start rant**
What a surreptitious policy. The government pockets from 1 to 11 months for each of us if we delay retirement but don't start in January. Why don't they calculate your benefit with the correct delayed credits from the start? If their software is archaic and can't, fine - but pay retroactively what is due. Sure, once you realize what they've done, you can go back and read their policy and understand what it meant. 

=&gt; If you retire before age 70, some of your delayed retirement credits will not be applied until the January after you start receiving benefits.

But no one spells it out that you potentially lose hundreds in your first year.

retirement,"This year was the first year where we exceeded the income ceiling for being able to contribute to a Roth IRA. Of course, I didn't know that that would be the case until well after I'd already made my contributions. My tax accountant (Turbo Tax) said I'd need to withdraw the Roth IRA contributions from last year and reallocate them to a Traditional IRA - What are the ramifications for just leaving them in the Roth? And how is that verified by the IRS?

My next question is regarding alternate investments for the would-be Roth IRA funds going forward; because of my income level there doesn't seem to be any tax deduction advantages to contributing to a Traditional IRA so would that even still be a good investment at this point or should I just consider investing the money into stocks or indices through a financial institution like Schwab or Fidility or something? Also, for context, I already max out my 401k so I can't increase contributions there.

retirement,"Hello all,

We are in a pickle...

We need some good advice on where we should start, but first a short story.

We started off very poor and we had to work very hard to get to where we are now. My Fiancee managed to become LPN which progressed into her becoming an RN with an Associate Degree. I am currently working on getting into a flight school to become a pilot which is a huge dream of mine.

Over the past decade, we have managed to save up to $85,000. Now, we are thinking of trying to figure out a way to aggressively save for retirement. We are hoping for possibly early retirement. We have no idea what to do with the money we saved up to help with retirement.

Today all we hear is that there is a potential recession and that there is going to be a potential crisis. So far there is this war with Russia going against Ukraine. Then we are hearing about a war between the US against China over Taiwan. We are hearing everyone talking about how the stock market is going to be pretty violated for some time. We are also hearing that the stock market may crash big time.

I wished we had invested a lump sum of that money into a 401k because of the upward trend that we have been seeing for the past decade. But now I am not sure if that is such a good idea. The main reason why we didn't put that money into a 401k is that we were planning to use the money to buy a house. We ended up finding a very good large home for a very good price. Our mortgage stands at about $600 a month with 3.5% interest for 2000 sqft with a massive garage separated garage that is between 1500 sqft. It was originally an investment property until Covid hit. We are starting to think that this may be a permanent home for us.

The home was a fixer-upper. We managed to get a very good loan from the city that is 15 years with no interest. It was about $30,000. The home has new sidings, kitchens, fencing, mini splits, windows, etc. I did all of the work myself because it was significantly cheaper.

I know that we are off to a very good start and that we are in our early 30's. But here are the problems that we are facing. My fiancee is getting the feeling of being burned out. She has been hopping jobs in hope of finding a stable job with no luck. The current job that she has now is a state job. She gets very good health insurance with $2500 max out of pocket. The job also comes with a pension that she has to pay into for 5 years to qualify for the retirement plan. There is no 401k plan here. She is already thinking of finding another job because of the extreme workload and she is getting burned out.

She is also pressuring me into having a baby when I have not figured out my career path. I am not guaranteed to get into flight school at the moment. I am going through the Medical Evaluation that I have been dealing with for over a year. She gets upset when I tell her that it is not the time to think about a baby. She is worried about being too old to have a baby.

I am not sure if finding a financial advisor is a good option. I fear that because of the huge sum, they will try to take advantage of it. I have no idea how to find out if the financial advisor is in for the best of us or for themselves.

I have a friend who I am close with, with some advice that we should do a three-thirds. One-third for risky, one-third for medium risk, and one-third for low risk. She also explains that if we go in for the long term, we are bound to make money back. I am afraid of losing a lot of money and then it takes forever for it to grow back. I am afraid of never being able to retire.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",t2_4pgw2bod,0,What route should we take?,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,11ak749,True,PrettyRose01,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/11ak749/what_route_should_we_take/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/11ak749/what_route_should_we_take/,19496.0,1677218825,0.0,,False,1677218840,1677218840,2023-02-24 06:07:05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"Update: as someone who never created a spending budget (like below), I finally did one as we get closer to retirement. Tried Mint and Personal Capital, but neither worked well for me (PC couldn't download all transactions). So I tried Fidelity's Full Account view and can now see what we're spending -- and it's 40% more than I realized (largely due to travel, restaurants, higher-than-expected car costs). Also, the little stuff really adds up. So now I can see where we need to cut back and also may need to source more ""guaranteed income,"" something like an annuity.

Do you or someone you care for live in a senior living community (Assisted Living, Independent Living, Nursing Home, Memory Care, etc), receive in-home care, or have you considered such options? 3S Health is recruiting participants for a focus group on the topic of senior living communities and in-home care for older adults. We are seeking individuals who have experience taking part in the consideration process and/or decision to move themselves or someone they care for (parent, grandparent, etc) into one of these communities or to receive in-home care. 

Participants must be available on **Wednesday, March 8 from 1 - 2:30pm EST**. The focus group will take place virtually and participants will be compensated.

If you’re interested in participating in this focus group, **please fill out this interest form:** [**https://forms.gle/f8LHTsg1Zi3soAxh9**](https://forms.gle/f8LHTsg1Zi3soAxh9)

## About This Focus Group

The purpose of this focus group is to gain insight on the experience of taking part in the consideration and/or decision to move into a senior living community or receive in-home care for older adults. This decision often involves multiple stakeholders, including the individual in need of the care and the people that care for and support that individual. The insights gathered in this focus group will be used in our consumer-facing content directed at people considering this decision. We will only use anonymized quotes and insights from the focus group discussion in our content. While the session will be recorded for future reference and research, we will not use the recording in our content.",t2_o2b68c5b,0,Senior Living Focus Group,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,119fg8m,True,Ok-Disk2871,,1,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/119fg8m/senior_living_focus_group/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/119fg8m/senior_living_focus_group/,19473.0,1677103752,0.0,,False,1677103770,1677174241,2023-02-22 22:09:12,self,,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/otW8PLWXwTvp2kJ0LMt6TEsckcwSXfPh3FtXUpgRtlI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=316dae10ca4f8aa8e01b68dcc2eb9be3c3816c73', 'width': 1200, 'height': 630}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/otW8PLWXwTvp2kJ0LMt6TEsckcwSXfPh3FtXUpgRtlI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b10b944df3ca38f240f65bb9a2c6a295d92f75ae', 'width': 108, 'height': 56}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/otW8PLWXwTvp2kJ0LMt6TEsckcwSXfPh3FtXUpgRtlI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c2bdd9774c4ba57f9b43a5b54ed956fd7cb102cd', 'width': 216, 'height': 113}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/otW8PLWXwTvp2kJ0LMt6TEsckcwSXfPh3FtXUpgRtlI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5d4e82c5f8414506839f91c9da6dcaac8a005144', 'width': 320, 'height': 168}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/otW8PLWXwTvp2kJ0LMt6TEsckcwSXfPh3FtXUpgRtlI.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b5188ba2dde373d8e41f908e1e5a3a2564f777d7', 'width': 640, 'height': 336}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/otW8PLWXwTvp2kJ0LMt6TEsckcwSXfPh3FtXUpgRtlI.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=41eae76217368b2826d7bf14006b1ff7fd22a4f5', 'width': 960, 'height': 504}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/otW8PLWXwTvp2kJ0LMt6TEsckcwSXfPh3FtXUpgRtlI.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8874373250c1edf25399e53bad7e44a60ca007bd', 'width': 1080, 'height': 567}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'NkWR7iy2XV-2t7j-fDoB4DRPfP5rDvUxAwi1PA7wgc4'}], 'enabled': False}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

*Q. You retired, then unretired last year. Is retirement overrated?*

*A. “Retirement” is a scary word. I mean, you’re not retiring from life. So, when I am done with football, I believe I have many chapters to write. You’ve got to keep your mind busy. You’ve got to keep your body active. You’ve got to keep your spirit active. You’ve got to do things you enjoy doing with people you enjoy doing them with.*

*Q. Let’s say the moment eventually comes. What would an ideal day of retirement look like?*

*A. You know, 23 years into this career, some decompression and relaxation would be good. It would be nice to be a little slower paced in the morning. I still want to be really productive with things that I’m doing in the midday and then make sure I’m a present father for my kids and give them all the time they need.*  


Makes sense to me! It describes my retirement well, substituting “my spouse” (who is still working) for “my kids”.

Everything I've read elsewhere seems to lead me to ""WHICH IS BETTER A ROTH OR A TRADITIONAL iRA...""

There has to be more to it than that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm by no means destitute but my income is not high and fluctuates.  I'm self employed. Wife is raising the kids and making limited money.  We're essentially a 1 income family.

I'm in a low tax bracket so the limited research I've done has me thinking I should be throwing as much as I can at a Roth ira.

Roth sounds like the best idea because in case of an emergency I can...

1 access it without penalty and

2 I'm in a low bracket now and I'm trying to make that go up.

Other than that I have a very low amount of cash savings/ investments and a rental property that's doing a little better than covering expenses... I'm lucky to rent where we live for an unreasonably low amount.

Can i get some real world experience?  If you just want to tell me I'm stupid and screwed then keep that to yourself.  I already feel that way.  If you have similar experience or suggestions to improve my planning I'd really appreciate your input!

retirement,"Curious to hear from folks that retired when they hit their employer’s “magic number” (well before being eligible for SSI and medicare) to receive health insurance benefits for life (paid in whole, or in part, by said employer). Yet still needed to work and fund their retirement kitty. What did you go on to do for employment?

In a few years, I will reach my company’s “age of 75” that will allow me to officially retire with health benefits. I will continue to be able to pay the same monthly cost for my health insurance, and at 65, my supplemental medicare costs would be defrayed.

retirement,"How do you handle feelings of guilt as you try to enjoy your retirement as others around you are struggling?  I am very fortunate to be enjoying a modest retirement that allows me to make small charitable donations.  However, I'm struggling with guilt every time I spend money on something pleasurable for myself while elders I know are having financial difficulties, ranging from mild to very serious.

I am now being asked to contribute to the dementia care expense of an extended family member who, despite having lived a luxurious lifestyle while running an successful business, saved nothing for retirement and did nothing to protect her interests when she was initially diagnosed.  She will probably end up in adult foster care if her extended family doesn't finance the monthly 4-figure gap between her benefits and the cost of her care.  

I struggle with the guilt of not being willing to contribute a significant portion of my discretionary budget so that my relative can live in a nicer place, despite her complete lack of planning.  If you are a person who cares about the lives of others, what are your thoughts about this?

retirement,"My FRA is 66 and 4 months, which I hit last month.  But I'm still working and plan to delay my social security until July (when I'll be 66 and 10 months) -- believing (from some places I've read) that the amount received will be increased by 2/3 of 1% every month of delay.  

OTOH, the retirement calculator on [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov) shows that my monthly amount remains the same for 66 and 5 months through 67 and 3 months, and only bumps up when I get to the full YEAR of delay at 67 and 4 months.  This doesn't seem right -- or is it???

If it's only bumped up on the yearly anniversary of FRA, then it seems that I ought to apply to start collecting it NOW, even while I continue to work through the end of June.

retirement,"Any good deals (ha-ha!) for dental and vision insurance for senior citizens?

I'll be taking early retirement from my job on 31 March and will turn 65 in September. I do not want to retire, but I live with my elderly, widowed father whose mental condition is deteriorating, and my brothers &amp; I have agreed not to have dad put in a nursing home, and he doesn't want it either. They are in no position to leave their careers to care for him--both are married, one lives 1,000 miles away while the other is 10 miles away. I'm divorced with children and grandchildren living across the country, so I'm in a better position (somewhat) to care for our father as I don't have extra family responsibilities (except for dad). The brother closest to me helps as much as he can and is always willing to fix things around the house and checks on dad regularly.

I've never had a career, only jobs, and have had one job after another. I've applied for my SS check which starts in April--which I'd done it sooner--but since I've never had a career, it won't be a large amount, about $1000 per month. I've been a receptionist for a non-profit organization since 2012. I moved in with dad after mom died three years ago, he pays for everything (HOA, water, electric, property tax, cable) while I'm responsible for my own bills and I buy all the groceries. I'm debt free although I've recently run up a big dental bill (oral surgery, implants, crowns) as my insurance doesn't cover it all. I don't earn much money (an understatement) but I don't have as many expenses, either. I only have about $21,000 in my 401-K, not very much, and I absolutely don't want to touch that money if possible. Dad is leaving me the the house (an old mobile home) and most of his savings/investments, which don't add up to much but that's okay. Right now it seems as though I can survive on my monthly SS check and a VA pension (ex-hubby was career military), it's around $2000/per month.

Question: I'm a veteran and am not worried about medical insurance as I can use the VA, and then I can use Medicare if I want, but I can't find reasonable dental insurance--and my teeth are costing me a fortune. I'd like to avoid spending all of it on dental/vision care, although I've heard that just paying out of pocket is sometimes cheaper than insurance. I may not get paid very much, but I only pay about $50 a month right now for medical/dental/vision. All that will stop beginning in April &amp; I have no idea how much I'll have to shell out. I want to avoid asking dad for help. I know he'll do it, yet I don't want to unless I'm desperate.

I can't understand why Medicare doesn't cover this stuff--your eyes and teeth tend to worsen as your age.

I'd appreciate any suggestions or recommendations on good insurance for someone who will have to start paying out of pocket for insurance or treatment. I'm not used to this and am afraid it will wipe me out financially.",t2_hofjn,0,Dental &amp; Vision Insurance on a Limited Income,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,117fkzf,True,ilovelucygal,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/117fkzf/dental_vision_insurance_on_a_limited_income/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/117fkzf/dental_vision_insurance_on_a_limited_income/,19429.0,1676915624,0.0,,False,1676915635,1676915636,2023-02-20 17:53:44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that by 2034, Social Security will not have enough money to fully fund its obligations.  In other words, as of that year, they cannot continue to pay out 100% of the amounts to retirees.  The amount that SS can afford to pay will be reduced to 77% going forward from that point.  

Will Congress fix this before 2034 such that there will be no reduction?  There are a number of ways that it can be fixed; here are the 4 most popular ways:  

1. Lift the cap on taxing earnings for SS.  As of 2023, the first $160,200 of your earnings are taxed.  Any earnings you receive above that are not taxed.  Lifting this cap entirely would be the most effective way of aiding SS.  
2. Put in a means test for collecting social security.  Right now, if you pay money into the system, you can get money out of the system - no matter how much your net worth is upon retirement.  A means test would examine your 
3. Raise the retirement age.  This has already been done due to lengthening life spans.  The ""full retirement age"" used to be 65.  In 1983, Congress passed an increase, which has been phased in to the point where those people born in or after 1960 now cannot collect their full retirement benefits until age 67.  People can still retire before full retirement age, starting at age 62, and receive reduced benefits.  Both the minimum age and the full age can both be raised again, as life expectancies continue to rise.   
4. Increase the SS payroll tax.  In 2023, you pay 6.2% tax on the first $160,200 of earnings; and your employer matches that 6.2% payment.  Obviously, this rate can be increased.  

There's a good article describing these ways, and a few others, and their effects, [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/changes-americans-are-willing-to-make-to-fix-social-security.html).  

I know that saying this may be a fool's errand, but try not to get too heated in your political rants.

retirement,"Hello everyone!

My name is Ryan and I am a graduate student at CUNY School of Professional Studies. I am conducting a research study to examine the possible effects that working in older adulthood may have on their perceived social support and well-being. If you're over the age of 65, I would like to invite you to participate by clicking the link below. It will take you to a simple questionnaire which should only take about 5 to10 minutes to complete.

You identity will remain anonymous during and after the study and I do collect emails. However, this is so that I can send you an email to debrief you after the research is concluded as well as enter you into a raffle for a gift card!

Thank you in advance to anyone who chooses to participate or share it with any older adults in their lives who may!

retirement,"As I am zeroing in on retirement, I'm not sure if that is the correct word. I work for the US govt and will turn 65 before the EOY. I am concerned what my job is doing to me mentally so decided to retire to my own gig. My own gig is related to what I have done for the govt for 17 years. I have no customers, and the govt won't let me test the waters.

So I am not planning to stop working. I just plan to stop working for the man. What do I call this? I have seen encore retirement.  But while considering volunteering opportunities, I realized it is pretty hard to explain encore retirement.

I’m new to purchasing stocks and I’ve noticed that I don’t enjoy doing this. My initial  goal was to get into the market, but play the long game and purchase safe options. Lately I realize I don’t enjoy buying stocks, and having to keep track of the market with my dollar cost averaging approach… Would it make more sense for me to sell off my portfolio, and increase my retirement contribution to 4-6% and take the set it and forget it method? If that makes any sense. This way I don’t have to worry about buying stock since my retirement account is automatically investing on my behalf. Also the money I was investing into stocks can now directly go into my retirement account.

retirement,"I've recently started looking at a bit of estate planning as I am aging.  I am still a number of years from retirement, but my health isn't perfect and given my family history, I probably won't be around to enjoy more than a few years of it when I get there before I pass on.  Most of my planning revolves around making sure that my wife, who is nine years younger than myself, is taken care of when I pass on. One thing I discovered recently is that a regular taxable investment account has 1 major advantage over a tax deferred retirement account, at least for someone in my circumstances.

When I pass on, my wife will inherit everything. The money in my traditional 401k will be taxed as regular income when she draws upon this money. But the assets in my normal investment account enjoy 1 special benefit. Currently if I sell shares from my investment account (which I have no intention of doing) I would have to pay long term capital gains based upon the cost basis of those shares when I sell.  But should I pass away, the cost basis of all of those shares is reset to the price of the stock on the day I passed away.

Example: I was lucky enough to buys shares of Microsoft (MSFT) at $36 a share many years ago.  Today it is bouncing around the upper $200s per share.  I would have to pay taxes on around $225/share in capital gains.  But if I died today, the cost basis resets to today's price.  My wife would pay capital gains on a cost basis, if I passed away today, of around $262.  That is a lot of tax savings for her!

And since my estate is nowhere near the $5 Million exclusion for my state's estate taxes or the $12.92 Million exclusion for federal estate taxes, my estate would pay no taxes before transferring my assets to my wife.  My state is unfortunately one that also charges a roughly 10% ""inheritance tax"" to people who inherit (in addition to the state estate tax and the federal estate tax if you exceed the exclusions on these) but for immediate family members such as my wife this tax is not assessed.

Now I am not saying that this one advantage makes a taxable account ""better"" than a tax-deferred account, but it does give those of us who use these accounts in addition to tax deferred accounts one good thing if we have relatives that we are looking to provide for when we pass on. As for me, I am continuing to build both my 401k and my taxable accounts so I will hopefully buck the trend of other men in my family and enjoy a long retirement (none of them have even lived TO retirement age). And if not, at least it will help a bit for taking care of my wife when she outlives me by quite a long time.",t2_vbgpd,0,One advantage to having a brokerage account vs. 401k/IRA/etc.,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,114l381,True,Sebekiz,,0,False,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/114l381/one_advantage_to_having_a_brokerage_account_vs/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/114l381/one_advantage_to_having_a_brokerage_account_vs/,19347.0,1676642787,0.0,,False,1676642803,1676642804,2023-02-17 14:06:27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"My wife and I live in north nj, one of the most affluent suburbs in the US. We live in a 120 year old stone house on about .5 acres but surrounded by a park on 2 sides and some woods from an office building on the other. 

Our taxes are about 10k/ year and I'll be retiring by the EOY. We don't have any neighbors close by and this has led to a lonely existence for the past 27 years.

There are some reasons for staying here such as I have cancer and my Dr's are just about 1/2 hour away. And my dog loves the property. I hate the stadium lights from the park and the large amount of unmufflered traffic.  On the staying side, I play with a jazz band here and it is not easy to find that at 64 years old.i hate the snow, I am an outside kind of guy.

So there are pros and cons. My wife wants to leave our house to our 27 yo daughter, who lives about 1.5 hours from here while she is getting her phD in pharma. Nj is a center for pharma jobs. Our house is probably 1/3 of our wealth.

retirement,"So, I'll most likely have somewhere between $1.2 and $1.4 million when me and the wife retire in about a dozen years.  We've got two-thirds of a million right now; we'll each continue to max out our Roths - $7500/year x 12 years x 2 of us = $180K; and additional investments in our non-retirement accounts of about $10K per year x 12 years = $120K.  So that's practically a million right there with 

We have no bonds.  Let me repeat that: 

# WE HAVE ZERO PERCENT IN BONDS.  

Shouldn't we consider our SS payments to be the equivalent of bonds, or an annuity?  I was a high-income earner for a lot of my life, and my wife is and continues to be.  The SS calculator for each of us says we'll be getting $3500/month each at full retirement age 70.  $7K/month = $84K per year.  

That's fixed income payments - which is exactly what bonds would give us.  At a 4% bond payout rate, that would be the equivalent of holding something like 

# TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS. 

Or, since I can't sell off any of that, you can think of it more as annuity.  A lifetime annuity for a 70-year old pays around 6%.  That's still the equivalent of buying an annuity for 

# $1.5 MILLION DOLLARS.  

To those who say that SS will run out of money in 2037, that's not exactly true.  SS will not be able to pay out 100% of its obligations by then.  But from what I understand and what I've read, it will still be able to pay out 75% of its obligations - basically forever.  And that's if Congress does nothing to fix it. in the meantime.  That's still $63K/year = $5250/month, which is the equivalent of having either $1.5 million in bonds, or buying an annuity for $1.125 million. 

This all leads to the question:  **if I'm going to get this much FIXED INCOME from SS - and I'll easily have one million in my portfolio -  what do I need bonds for?**",t2_17ituf,0,Why not think of Social Security as the equivalent of bonds/annuities,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,110wxl9,True,jgroub,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/110wxl9/why_not_think_of_social_security_as_the/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/110wxl9/why_not_think_of_social_security_as_the/,19266.0,1676254881,0.0,,False,1676254897,1676254898,2023-02-13 02:21:21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"I’m in my early 40s and work remotely and have the flexibility with my employer to move to any state we currently do business. I work for a large company so this is almost any state in the US plus Puerto Rico. I live in the midwest and assume I will either be a snowbird or move down south during retirement because I’m not a fan of our winter.  I got to thinking maybe I should just move now while my kids are in elementary school and increase the chances they will have ties to that location. Plus this will allow us time to settle and have a sense of community.

Potential downsides that I see include:
-moving far from our parents/siblings who all live within 30 minutes from our house
-We have a low interest rate on our house and are on track to having it paid off in 10 years. Would likely pay more for “less” house as our current home was built pre-crazy housing prices.
-We live in a good school district &amp; safe neighborhood. May not like new location.

Im leaning towards Alabama or North Carolina due to weather and the fact that my company has a big presence there (just in case I need to return to the office or I take a hybrid role) but Phoenix or Colorado are my husband’s top picks.

Or would you recommend the snowbird route? If we do that I’m assuming we would stay in the Midwest and spend 2-3 months somewhere warm. I would love to hear about anyone’s experience moving from the Midwest to somewhere with better weather or being a snowbird.

I’m about to turn 65 and retired about a year ago.  I haven’t touched my investments this far, but will need to start later this year.  Currently have a general investment account (not a retirement account), an IRA and a 401K which is in my old company’s Vanguard account.   The retirement accounts are NOT Roth.

I do not plan to take Social Security until I am 70 and about that time our mortgage will be paid off (I see no need to pay it off given the low fixed mortgage rate), so cash flow will increase significantly at that time.

retirement,"I know, at 20, 30 or 40 we do not think a lot about things like that, but if you already budget for retirement, you might as well factor in some health care costs. Let's assume you have Medicare at 65 and most of the medical costs are covered. But what about the need of assisted living at some point? I had no idea but was wondering what to roughly expect. I googled and found an interesting article with lots of statistics on assisted living: 

[https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-statistics](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/assisted-living-statistics)

Here are some numbers I found in the article, and I think the last three are important for my rough estimates. I assume that I am in average health and that there won't be additional costs for any devastating long-term diseases. 

Just a very rough estimate but according to the statistics one would need to budget 22 months x 4500=$99000. So $100K minus medium retirement income is $50K minimum. Of course, this depends on many other factors, like LCOL or VHCOL area, your actual retirement income and individual health and so on. 

I guess if some more serious disease comes up early in retirement, these numbers will increase drastically, though. I am also sure there is lots of horrible anecdotal evidence for these cases as well and the associated costs can get be exorbitant. On the other hand, the more frugal-minded may also look into organizing their very own assisted living arrangements and, for instance, share living space and cost of services on an as needed base.

 

* Assisted living communities offer long-term housing and care for seniors. Residents often need help with various activities of daily living (ADLs), such as dressing, bathing, and using the toilet, but they do not require 24-hour nursing or medical care.  
* 42% of residents experience Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia. 
* White, non-Hispanic families are the least likely to care for an aging relative at home, and they are the most likely to seek senior living communities before medically necessary. 
* Women in the U.S. tend to live longer than men. The average life expectancy for women is around 81 years, while the average life expectancy for men is 76 years 
* Approximately 71% of assisted living residents are female, while 29% are male.  
* The majority of residents move into assisted living communities between the ages of 75 and 84,  
* The average age of an assisted living resident is 87.  
* The median cost of a private, single bedroom unit in an assisted living facility is $4,500 per month. 
* The estimated average length of stay in an assisted living community was 22 months.

retirement,"I'm a canadian in my mid 20's.
Since the past 2 years, I used the services of a financial advisor who works for an independant private financial service group. 

All of my investments are currently in mutual funds who all have approx. 2,20% in management fees, ouch!

He took the time to analyse my earnings, debts and long-term / short-term goals. He suggested me to open a TFSA (equivalent to a Roth IRA)

He suggested me to invest the contribution I am allowed to all in Fidelity Global Equity Mutual Fund (FID7601). 
Since this is for the long term (retirement) and that I won't touch this money for 30-35 years from now, I am worried about the total management fees which are at 2,26%.

Each dollar lost in fees, is a dollar less growing.

Over a few decades, it will cost me hundread of thousand of dollars in fees. I would have to cross my fingers the mutual fund he suggested me beats the market by at least 2,26% on the long term. The statistics say it's highly against my favour.

Would I be better to directly open an account with Fidelity or Vanguard and make my own portfolio with a passively managed fund like an Idex fund or ETF? The fees would be much lower. 

I know it's against his advantage to suggest me a passively managed fund, because it means lower fees therefore less money for him.

retirement,"I see a number of people working very hard and saving in a 401(k) or IRA (or Roth IRA). Are you aware of the 4% rule? Have you spoken to your advisor about it? 

Google ‘The Trinity Study’ and read up on this. The safe withdrawal rate from a 401(k) or IRA in retirement is 4%. Why? 

If you are like me, you’ve sat in a room with your colleagues at work and listened to a financial advisor tell you that when you’re young, you can accept more risk, as even if your account value drops, the market always rebounds and you’ll make up the difference and then some. In your later years, you need to be more risk adverse, to protect your money, converting stocks to bonds. That conversion slows you’re rate of growth to provide security. In order to preserve your money with that slower rate of growth you should only withdraw 4% per year. Factor in compounding management fees and your money isn’t going that far when you need it, in retirement. 

Go to vanguard.com and run your numbers on the retirement calculator, it’s there in black and white. 

There are alternatives to the 4% rule. Whether you want to entertain them is up to you. Just understand that between management fees and placing your money in conservative investments when you need it the most, in order to make sure you don’t run out of money before you die, your recommended withdrawal rate (as will be confirmed by your advisor) is 4%.

retirement,"Hi all! I decided to share my approach to the choice of dividend stocks, maybe someone will be interested

I divided my needs into separate industries and choose dividend companies among the leaders of this market. 

The logic is that if some products will grow more expensive than inflation, then the dividends of companies in this sector will grow at a similar rate, and therefore I will still have enough dividends to buy the products of this company.

In theory, this should safeguard my dividend flow from global demand changes, compared to if I had simply chosen the companies with the largest and most stable dividends. It also answers the question of exactly how to diversify my choice of dividend stocks.

* Food (including bars and cafes) - $250,000
* Gadgets and appliances - $47,000
* Utility bills and household goods - $130,000
* Internet and streaming fees - $30,000
* Medical - $500,000 (probably best to move out of the US)

retirement,"My wife and I are in our early 30s, but it's never too early to start thinking of when and how to retire. We want to retire early, like in our 50s, and if possible, earlier. The way we see it: the sooner we can exit the rat race, the better.

What are some good places, that are dirt cheap to live, but are also great for retirement? Places that come to mind: Costa Rica, Panama, Vietnam, or Malaysia. Our logic is, if it costs less to live, then that's more years of retirement you have. Maybe $1M can get you so many years in the US, but could get you so many more in Thailand. 

We've also thought about ""semi-retirement,"" where we do a low-stress, low-paying job in our later years to just pay the bills and then fully retire when our 401Ks and Roth IRAs mature enough and we are close enough to maxing out on social security.

retirement,"There was a recent post in which the Redditor asked how people could accumulate enough money to retire while also raising children. In response, a lot of people posted strategic and tactical ways to save money for retirement, while still paying the normal expenses related to child-rearing. Those suggestions were excellent, and I can't add to them.

However, I want to point out an opportunity that arose in our marriage during the time between ""I do"" and the arrival of the first child. In the four years during our marriage before our first child was born, my wife and I saved an amount equal to about sixteen months of our combined salaries. We put that money into a mutual fund portfolio with a mix of about 75% stocks and 25% bonds. That was about 29 years ago.  During the first 28 years after we opened the account, we did not add any ""new"" money to the account, and did  not sell any shares. We reinvested all capital gain and dividend distributions. Late last year, I sold about 4% of the shares to fund a Donor Advised Fund account (which will eliminate our federal income tax liability for 2022),

According to my favorite Monte Carlo simulator, Vanguard Nest Egg Calculator, there is a 99% probability that this account will pay all of our annual expenses for the next 20 years. By that time, of course, we will qualify for  the maximum Social Security old age benefits, and will also have to take RMDs from our retirement accounts.  In other words, during the first four years of our marriage, before we had to deal with child-rearing expenses, we saved enough money to support us for 20 years in retirement. 

So, if there are any people reading this who have not yet had children, please take advantage of the opportunity that you have to save money early in your marriage, before children come along.",t2_s8jw7fdl,0,Retiring after raising children--2.0,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,10xkeop,True,SupermarketFormal516,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/10xkeop/retiring_after_raising_children20/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/10xkeop/retiring_after_raising_children20/,19178.0,1675914219,0.0,,False,1675914232,1675914233,2023-02-09 03:43:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"Hi Reddit, 

Usually I just lurk but I’ve been feeling extra stressed about saving lately. Currently I am a teacher with 16k invested into my pension fund (however I may leave teaching and start over with a 401k) and I have 60k in a saving account.

My partner also has around 60k in savings but we are saving for a house in Ca which is unfortunately very expensive. I want to start saving but I don’t know where to start, I’m unsure if I should put into a high yields saving account or what to invest into a Roth IRA

I make about 4K a month and my expenses are low right now. I give my parents about 1000 dollars a month plus helping out with bills and incidentals. I manage to save about 2k a month. 

As first generation Americans my boyfriend and I know we will each have to give our parents 500-800 a month even after we move out to help them with living expenses.

retirement,"I am guessing that a lot of people dream of retiring so that they can devote time to things like restoring old cars, bronze sculpting, or woodworking. Has anyone been able to take up this sort of hobby *after* retirement? I'm sure there are a lot of people who have been doing it all along, and already own all of the equipment and space, but are able to devote their attention full-time after retirement, but I'm asking if anyone has been able to take up such hobbies from scratch, acquire all of the equipment and space, knowing you won't get to use it for very long.

There are quite literally tons of equipment and art pieces to get rid of. She, however, has never had to relocate and has never had a normal job, so it is a matter of 50 years of equipment and art accumulating.

Specifically, I have always wanted to take up bicycle frame building as a hobby, but as you can imagine, that takes up a lot more space and equipment than something like crossword puzzles. Unlike my mom, I've been working for 30+ years in an incredibly fickle industry, so I've had to relocate more times than I can remember for work. Every time I've moved, I've purged, which included a lot of hobby stuff. I have lived in a string of tiny 1 bedroom condos and apartments for my entire career and have never had things like a garage, a yard, or a basement.

Now that I'm hopefully 8-10 years out, I'm realizing that if I invest all this money and space in hobbies, not to mention a house to put them in, I won't really have that long to actually do them. I figure I might have maybe 10 years or so before I found I wasn't physically capable anymore and would have to get rid of it all. It kind of makes me wonder if I should find some less involved hobbies for retirement.",t2_qjpzg,0,"Were you able to start any new, expensive, and space-consuming, equipment-heavy hobbies after you retired?",[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,10w5b8u,True,Sintered_Monkey,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/10w5b8u/were_you_able_to_start_any_new_expensive_and/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/10w5b8u/were_you_able_to_start_any_new_expensive_and/,19156.0,1675785483,0.0,,False,1675785497,1675785497,2023-02-07 15:58:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"My friend inherited her deceased spouses stock portfolio  3 years ago. She told me the stocks were valued around $200k at that time but are worth about $140k now. She is considering selling and putting the proceeds into an interest bearing account. Her broker advises against this. 

Tax implications are what is holding her back on selling. It is my understanding that the original value of the stocks in her case would be the stock value at time of inheritance so she would have capital gains loss. Is this right?

She sold their house 2 years ago and put that money in an interest bearing account. She collects SS survivor benefits and has a 401k, which will require withdrawal at 73, correct?

She is really stressing over what to do to preserve the value of these stocks. 

I should add that she is renting now, but planning to purchase. Proceeds from her house sale will not cover full price of another home as husband had refinanced and spent equity withdrawal. She would need to either sell stocks or get a mortgage on future house.

I clearly cannot advise her but I'd like to be able to discuss rhia accurately with her.

Ideal, for me, meaning part time hours that are at least somewhat flexible, ability to take off a fair amount of time for travel, at least mildly interesting/challenging but not super high-pressure warp speed, minimal commute. I don't even know what kind of jobs, if any, would meet those criteria!

retirement,"Hello, my dad is retiring soon and he wants to find a meaningful job but isn’t sure what to do. He has a pretty strict “things I can’t do” list and it’s hard to narrow it down to something that checks all the boxes he’s looking for. Hoping you guys here can help out.

1.) He can NOT stand for long periods of time; he doesn’t mind moving around a lot or sitting but he can’t STAND STILL for long periods of time 
2.) He is ONLY looking for work that is MEANINGFUL. This means he has little interest in doing something let pet sitting or teaching history (he has a bachelor’s in history). He is more interested in helping refugee children, helping the elderly, etc. Basically anything that makes him feel like he’s actively making peoples lives better or the world a better place.
3.) He ISN’T good at conversing for long periods of time. He’s introverted and is good at talking around his friends but with strangers he tries to keep his conversation to a bare minimum. If he was to work with people, he would not want to go through small talk, he would just want to talk to them about things that are important or necessary.

retirement,"I don't have any family that is able or willing to help. My husband died several years ago. Due to some personal problems and health concerns, I'm not comfortable living alone. I am not poor but I need to be wise about money. 

Ideally, I'd love to find something like an intentional community of older folks, but most of the ones I've found either require a $200,000+ buy in (where you buy a tiny house in the commune) or they have a bunch of children. I'm looking for something that's peaceful, settled and quiet, where I can form new friendships with like-minded souls. 

Alternatively, I'd love to find a shared home situation, where I can split expenses with someone who has a spacious home. I did that 20 years ago, and it worked beautifully for me and the homeowner. I've tried countless ""home-sharing"" websites but to no avail.

I would be grateful to hear any and all ideas. I was engaged to a man that was the love of my life, and we had a beautiful set-up (sharing expenses in his condo), but then he found someone he liked better and ditched me the day after Christmas. I was so grateful to have found him, and I thanked God every day for him, but he had no hesitation about putting me out of his life. I'm still hurting from the abrupt break up (and eviction). I'm currently living with a lovely couple, but this is temporary.

retirement,"retirement in Canada

Married couple 57m (A) and 55m (B) with no kid and no debt. A is still working with 140K salary and B has retired now with 30K per year pension for life and A has pension lump sum of 200K.  The combined TSFA : 14000 and RRSP: 700K, saving: 80K.  Roth IRA worth of CAD 250K (A's previous job was in USA).  House worth 1.3mil (no mortgage). Wondering if A can retire now if the goal is to get 70K/year after tax?  We live in Toronto, Canada for only 20 years. So we will only get 50% of OAS at 65.    Thinking about delaying CPP to 70.  Life expectancy is 90.   Try to get some advice here before finding a financial advisor.

I grew up on a farm and always plinked and hunted until I moved to the city to further my education.

I've owned these properties for 6 years, 4 years, and 13 years, respectively, which are earning positive cash flow of about $4K per month after taxes, etc.  The Hawaii home is valued at $2 million, the Los Angeles house is $1.5 to 1.6 million, and the Inland Empire home is $700K. For retirement, I have about $340K+. My spouse will get a $9,000 to $13,000 state pension per month when he turns 61 (he has about 28 years more to get there.  He makes about $110K to $120K between his job and royalties from his book. My business varies and so I bring in anywhere from $150K to $400K depending on the year, but on average, it's about $200K. We have two more homes but we live in one and do not rent the other one out. The mortgage is very low and so we figure we just keep it for the time being. I don't know how much I'll be getting in SS but I've been putting in a lot of great years, working for large employers making $210K and then to working for myself making the above on average.

retirement,"Let’s begin

By the way I have a gift for you at the end of this post.

1) Mortgage

Mortgages can keep the middle class poor because they often involve taking on significant debt in order to purchase a home. This debt can take years or even decades to pay off, during which time a significant portion of one's income is committed to paying mortgage interest and principal. This can limit one's ability to save and invest, reduce disposable income, and make it difficult to cope with unexpected expenses or emergencies. Additionally, if property values decline, homeowners may find themselves owing more than the value of their home, which can make it difficult to refinance or sell their property. As a result, homeownership, which is often seen as a means of building wealth, can become a burden that contributes to financial insecurity for many middle-class families.

2) Credit card interests

Credit card interest can keep the middle class poor because they can lead to a cycle of debt. Credit cards often come with high interest rates, which can cause debt to accumulate quickly if the cardholder is unable to pay the balance in full each month. This can lead to minimum payments that only cover the interest, meaning the cardholder is not making any progress towards paying down the debt. Over time, the interest and fees can become so high that a significant portion of the cardholder's income is being used to service the debt, leaving little for other expenses or for building savings and wealth. This can also lead to financial insecurity and increase the risk of default, which can have long-lasting impacts on one's credit score and financial health.

3) Higher education

Higher education can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class in several ways. Firstly, college tuition and fees have been rising faster than inflation for many years, making it more difficult for families to afford higher education for their children. This can result in taking on large amounts of student loan debt, which can be difficult to repay, especially if the student is unable to secure a well-paying job after graduation. Secondly, the opportunity cost of pursuing higher education, including lost wages and the cost of living expenses, can also be significant. This can reduce the amount of money that students and their families have available for saving, investing, and building wealth, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Finally, the burden of student loan debt can also make it more difficult for graduates to make other important financial decisions, such as buying a home or saving for retirement, which can further contribute to financial insecurity.

4) Constant Smartphone upgrades

Constant smartphone upgrades can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they can be expensive and add up over time. Smartphones are often marketed as must-have devices that are quickly outdated, leading many people to upgrade to the latest models on a regular basis. This can result in significant recurring expenses, especially as the cost of smartphones continues to rise. Additionally, many people finance their smartphones through installment plans or carrier financing, which can result in paying higher prices overall and incurring interest and fees. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for saving and investing, contributing to financial insecurity in the long-term. The desire for constant upgrades can also contribute to consumer debt, which can have similar effects on financial security.

5) Luxury vehicles and car accessories

Luxury vehicles and car accessories can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are often expensive and require a significant investment. Purchasing a luxury vehicle or upgrading a car with expensive accessories can be tempting, but can also result in taking on significant debt or diverting resources away from more important financial goals such as saving for retirement or building an emergency fund. Additionally, owning a luxury vehicle can also result in higher operating costs, including higher insurance premiums, fuel costs, and maintenance expenses. These added expenses can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, contributing to financial insecurity in the long-term. Furthermore, luxury vehicles and car accessories can also be depreciating assets, meaning that they lose value over time, which can make it more difficult to sell the vehicle or trade it in for a newer model.

6) Premium cable and streaming services

Premium cable and streaming services can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are recurring expenses that can add up over time. While these services can be convenient and offer a wide selection of content, they can also be expensive and require a significant ongoing investment. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, subscribing to multiple services can also lead to ""subscription fatigue,"" where people have difficulty keeping track of their monthly expenses and may find themselves overspending on entertainment. This can also result in a cycle of debt, as people may use credit cards to finance their monthly expenses, incurring interest and fees that add to the overall cost of the services. Overall, premium cable and streaming services can be a source of financial stress, especially for those on a tight budget or struggling to make ends meet.

7) Home renovation and home decoration

Home renovation and decoration can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they are often expensive and can result in significant debt. While home improvements can be a source of pride and enjoyment, they can also be a financial burden if not approached with caution. Renovations and decorations can quickly become expensive, and financing these projects through loans or credit cards can result in high interest charges and fees. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, overspending on home renovations and decorations can also lead to financial stress, especially if the improvements do not increase the value of the property or do not meet the homeowners' expectations. Furthermore, many people may feel pressure to keep up with their neighbors or to have the latest and greatest home furnishings, which can lead to overspending and financial insecurity.

8) Dining out and takeout food

Dining out and takeout food can contribute to financial insecurity for the middle class because they can be expensive and add up over time. While these options can be convenient and provide a variety of food choices, they can also be a significant source of monthly expenses. Eating out or ordering takeout frequently can result in significant spending, especially if dining at high-end restaurants or ordering premium food items. This can reduce the amount of money that people have available for other important financial needs, such as saving and investing, which can contribute to financial insecurity in the long-term. Additionally, dining out and takeout food often involve discretionary expenses, meaning that they are not essential expenses, and can be reduced or eliminated altogether if necessary. By choosing to dine out or order takeout frequently, people may be diverting resources away from other important financial goals, which can contribute to financial insecurity. Furthermore, frequent dining out or takeout can also result in unhealthy eating habits, which can lead to additional health-related expenses.

9) Fitness classes and gym memberships

Fitness classes and gym memberships can lead to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These activities can be expensive, especially if they involve frequent participation or require a long-term commitment, such as a gym membership. Additionally, the cost of fitness classes and gym memberships can add up over time, making it difficult for people to afford other necessities, such as housing, food, and healthcare. Additionally, for some individuals, the social pressure to maintain a certain appearance or level of physical fitness can drive them to spend more money on these activities than they can afford. Ultimately, if not carefully managed, fitness classes and gym memberships can become a financial burden for the middle class, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being.

10) Gourmet food and specialty ingredients

Gourmet food and specialty ingredients can be a financial burden for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These items are often more expensive than regular food items, due to factors such as high-quality ingredients, artisanal production methods, and premium branding. Additionally, purchasing gourmet food and specialty ingredients on a regular basis can quickly add up, putting a strain on a household's budget. Moreover, these items are marketed as status symbols, leading some individuals to feel pressure to purchase them in order to maintain a certain image or lifestyle, even if they cannot afford to do so. Ultimately, if not managed carefully, gourmet food and specialty ingredients can contribute to financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

11) Videogames

Videogames can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. Many video games are expensive, especially new releases or popular titles. Additionally, video games often require additional purchases, such as DLC (downloadable content) or in-game purchases, which can add up over time. Furthermore, some individuals may feel pressure to keep up with the latest releases or to compete with others, leading them to spend more money on video games than they can afford. If not managed carefully, the cost of video games can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

13) Travel and Vacations

Travel and vacations can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. Travel and vacations can be expensive, especially if they involve airfare, lodging, meals, and other expenses. Additionally, some individuals may feel pressure to take expensive trips or to travel frequently, leading them to spend more money on travel and vacations than they can afford. Furthermore, some individuals may go into debt or incur other financial obligations in order to finance their travel plans, which can further exacerbate their financial problems. If not managed carefully, the cost of travel and vacations can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

14) Plastic water bottles

Plastic water bottles, while relatively inexpensive individually, can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed carefully. Purchasing plastic water bottles regularly, especially if they are used as the primary source of drinking water, can add up over time, putting a strain on a household's budget. Moreover, plastic water bottles create a significant amount of waste and contribute to environmental problems, including plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from their production and transportation. Therefore, using plastic water bottles can have indirect financial consequences for the middle class, as addressing the environmental problems caused by plastic waste can be expensive. Ultimately, if not managed carefully, the cost and environmental impact of plastic water bottles can contribute to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

15) Pet care and Pet grooming

Pet care and pet grooming can contribute to financial strain for the middle class if they are not managed properly. These expenses can be costly, especially if they involve frequent visits to a vet or pet grooming services, or if they involve high-end pet products. Additionally, some individuals may feel pressure to provide their pets with the best possible care, leading them to spend more money on pet care and grooming than they can afford. Furthermore, unexpected veterinary expenses, such as those resulting from an injury or illness, can add to the financial burden. If not managed carefully, the cost of pet care and pet grooming can put a strain on a household's budget, leading to increased financial stress and decreased overall well-being for the middle class.

15) Your friends and family

It is a well-known fact that the people we surround ourselves with have a significant impact on our lives. This is especially true when it comes to financial success and upward mobility. The middle class is no exception to this rule. In fact, their tendency to associate with others of the same socio-economic status may be one of the reasons why they remain stuck in the middle class.

One of the reasons why this phenomenon occurs is that people tend to feel comfortable with those who are similar to them. The middle class is made up of individuals who have achieved a certain level of financial stability and success, but are still a ways away from reaching the upper echelon of society. When they come together, they share similar values, experiences, and goals. As a result, they form strong bonds and relationships with one another.

However, while these relationships can be comforting and provide a sense of community, they can also be limiting. By surrounding themselves with others who are also in the middle class, these individuals are not exposed to new ideas, opportunities, and perspectives. As a result, they may not be as motivated to strive for more, or to seek out new ways to improve their financial situation.

The middle class’ tendency to associate with others of the same socio-economic status can keep them stuck in the middle class, preventing them from reaching their full financial potential. By surrounding themselves with individuals who are already financially successful, they can learn new strategies, gain access to resources, and be inspired to reach for more.

retirement,"So, I'm obviously asking so that you can look at what I'm doing and see if it makes sense.  My current ""plan"" is to retire on dividends in about a dozen or so years at age 70.  Me and my wife will collect about $7000 in SS each month, and my retirement portfolio will be well over a million by then.  It's currently at two-thirds of a million, mostly in VOO.  The million is a very, VERY conservative estimate. 

The plan would be to take my current investments, sell them off, and invest them in dividend ETFs.  It would be a mix of JEPI/DIVO/SCHD, with an emphasis on JEPI, and DIVO and SCHD thrown in to get some good growth to keep ahead of inflation.  I figure I can do a mix of something 60/20/20 respectively and get good growth and still get a nice month income of at least $5000 (about $60,000 per year).  Again, this is a very conservative estimate.  I think it'll be closer to $6000 per month.  

Obviously, this is subject to change to whatever the hot dividend producing ETF is in a dozen years.  

So, with that said, what is the role of bonds in a portfolio and plan like this?  Bonds are supposed to provide a steady source of income to flatten out the highs and lows of stocks.  You're ""supposed to"" hold a percentage of stocks equal to your 120 minus your age.  At age 70 I'm supposed to be 50/50 stocks and bonds - I'm only a dozen years away, and I'm at 0%.  

SS will be providing us with that steady monthly income.  What do I need bonds for?  

Even if SS gets cut after 2037 (the projected year when SS will not be able to cover its current level of payments), it is predicted to still be able to cover 75% of its obligations, basically forever.  $7000 x 75% = $5250 per month.  

Again, what's the role of bonds?  Do you collect SS and still hold bonds?  Why?  

Thanks in advance.",t2_17ituf,0,"For those who have retired on dividends and collect SS, what is the role of bonds in your portfolio?",[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,10tbkxo,True,jgroub,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/10tbkxo/for_those_who_have_retired_on_dividends_and/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/10tbkxo/for_those_who_have_retired_on_dividends_and/,19057.0,1675503134,0.0,,False,1675503149,1675503150,2023-02-04 09:32:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
retirement,"I'd like to make a full withdrawal from one retirement account. It's a Roth 401k with Fidelity, and though I understand little about retirement (I'm young), I do know that the money is already taxed.

The estimate page also says there may be an additional 10% early withdrawal penalty, and that 10% of my holdings are taxable (despite it being in a Roth 401k) so I'll lose an additional 2% to Federal taxes.

retirement,"I’m getting pretty close to retiring, I think. I’m 58 and have set the goal at 60, assuming I can get health insurance and the stock market cooperates. 

But even though I’ve really been focused on retirement for a long time (I mean, a LOOONNNNGGG time 😁), I actually am finding myself having second thoughts. There’s still this part of me that’s looking for the next great role or job title, that feels like I haven’t reached my full potential in my career and life. I don’t feel 58…. I feel 35 (except for my knees—those are definitely feeling 58). 

I’ve put down a lot of feeling that way to “programming”—ie, how we’re programmed, especially in the US that work is who we are, if we do good work we’re good people (thank you Protestant work ethic…) and just that who we ARE is, in large part, what we DO. And I’m sure that programming has a lot to do with how I’m feeling (I also blame movies like “Wall Street” and “Working Girl” and even “Baby Boom,” all movies that probably influenced me right around the time I was starting my career).

But I also just realized that probably a bigger reason for feeling that way is that honestly, I’ve been pretty much living someone else’s life. Which is of course related to that programming. But at some point I put my shoulder in and said “ok, this is just what we do,” and of course started making money (and often buying things to make me feel better about living someone else’s life). 

I’m an artistic type person, and making money has never really been that important to me, EXCEPT for the security money buys. Never wanted a big house or fancy car, I hate dressing up, I’m don’t even like to travel that much. I do like writing and art and music and making things…. And that’s kind of what I saw myself doing much earlier in life.

I feel like I went to the bus station intending to go to Miami but I got on the wrong bus and just realized I’m heading to Juneau, Alaska. And am almost there. 

And it’s not all about work, maybe not even mostly about work, but is about life, and work is a big part of that. 

So maybe I have time to changes busses in Seattle to head back to Miami. Maybe I won’t make it to Miami, but Panama City may not be too bad.

I'm about 3-5 years from retirement. Until then, I'm working on a part-time contract basis earning \~$60K year. I have another 40K income from investments and I can't do anything to avoid that  (it's an inherited IRA and RMDs are mandatory). For that reason, I'm over the limit to get an ACA subsidy (in my state, for my age, etc). and my premiums are really high.

I'm thinking of maxing out my (Roth) 401K to 24K just to reduce my income for ACA purposes. That would reduce the 60K to 34K. I would live on the 40K plus some savings and I have enough savings to do that. I'm 57 so I'm only tying up the Roth money for 2 years if I really need it (which I don't anticipate).

retirement,"Hello again! Im writing for my father whos about to turn 60 again for health tips. I got such an overwhelming amount of response last time that i wanted to ask for help here again! 

Recently, he just got most of his teeth removed. He smoked since the age of 15, and hasnt had the best diet and self-care within all of these years. His teeth and gums were ruined even though he had great dental “genes”. When my parents went to the dental clinic, after a lot of dentist shopping they found one that made more sense then the other ones who suggested a lot of deep cleaning (which would result in a lot of money thrown out and the teeth would just end up falling since they were shaking every time we went in for deep cleaning). Hes a proud greek for having had his teeth for this long, and now he seems really depressed over having partials. Especially his top partials. Its not comfortable at all for him. And hes a chef and loves the taste of food. The fact that he cant taste food as much is heartbreaking to him. And the plastic feel on the top of his mouth is really irritable. He really misses his teeth, even though they were less pleasant and shaking. I think he just started having a lot of pain in his teeth at one point, so we really started looking for the right dentist on his occasional days off. And the dentist said he’d only remove the bottom to see how he feels - but at the appointment it was the technician instead who spoke very little, and just left 10 teeth in his mouth. 

He’s ready to spend a lot more money now that all of it happened. And it’s heartbreaking to see him the way he is. We can hardly understand him speaking - its as if he has something in his mouth when he talks. Were trying to save our money to pay off the mortgage when its going to be due in 2-3 years, but with this now… 
We might be open to checking other countries out, such as mexico. My mom had all of her teeth done in Ukraine but w the war there, we cant rlly go there anymore.

retirement,"I just joined this group, and as like many, I want to retire. My perspective on my life, and what I value has changed these last couple of years. Losing my mom in 2019, and then my dad in 2022, really hits home. I was their caregiver for over 8 years, while managing their house, expenses, doctor’s appts, and then trying to take care of my own job, house, and family. After being in Outside Sales for 30 years, and going through what I have experienced these past 8 years, I’m completely burned out. Hate Sundays where I get that pit in my stomach thinking about work on Monday, and the pressures of sales targets, traveling, long meetings, etc. I think you get the picture. I’m fried and don’t want to do it anymore. Life is too short.
I have $2.1 in Retirement that consists of $300K in Qualified IRA’s inherited from my parents, $600K in Stocks/Mutual Funds/Treasuries, and $180K in Roth IRA’s. The remaining $1M is in 401K Rollovers from previous jobs. I have $200K in cash (Savings) along with Checking , etc. I have $76k in my current employer 401K. Total Retirement of close to $2.3M

House is paid for and we have no other debt. I have one son at home who is 19 and going to Trade school and working full-time. He will be leaving the house soon. My oldest son is 22 and has moved out of the house. He will graduate in May 2023. Their college education is paid for with our 529 Accounts.    There will be close to $40K left over from that account. 
We have a financial advisor who hasn’t been great in providing guidance. We since have met with 2-3 advisors that we’re thinking of moving our money too, and all have said that I’m in a good position. Our expenses are close to $90k, and that should come down further once our youngest leaves the nest. My wife makes close to $16K working PT, so that would reduce our expenses to roughly $74k. There is room to carve out some more.
I want the freedom to do what I want, and not have to have report in to somebody. Learn a new hobby. Enjoy life and not have a plan everyday, and just go with the flow. I worry about having too much idle time, but I’m sure everyone does. 
We’re very frugal people and don’t spend a lot of money. I’m a little scared, but at the same time excited about a new chapter in my life. 

I would appreciate any comments and thoughts as to whether or not I’m in good shape, and should not even think twice about moving forward with retiring.

retirement," 

I will be retiring this summer and scared as hell but my wife will be still working, she is 9 years my junior. I have a good benefits plan from my current employer of which I use the dental and some of the drug coverage. My wife uses more, dental, drugs as well as physiotherapy, natural path, massage, etc.

I’ve been calling around various insurance providers and it seems we could get a similar coverage for 400$ per month, 200$ each. We don’t know what my retirement means to us financially yet but we are reassured by our financial advisor/planner we will be ok, but we are both scared. So, does it make financial sense for both of us to get benefits for 400$ a month? Should we get benefits for my wife only for 200$ month and none for me, pocket 200$?

We were going to take our kids traveling all over the world before they graduated high school then settle down somewhere that the cost of living would let us spend some years retired before coming back to the US when we were really old. Now all that is in the trash. STBX is the high earner by a lot, and when she went to quit they offered her a promotion and she took it without even asking me. She tried bulling me into cancelling plans, and I filed for divorce when I got scared she was going to throw me out of the house. She's now a VP, and I am SAHD with very little income. I'm going to be stuck living in a high-COL city to see the kids thru high school, probably fighting for 50-50 custody. At 53 and in an equitable distribution state, I'll still have about $700k in IRAs and SEPs, plus maybe $110k in savings (depending on what the lawyers get), and another $150k from the equity in our house. Those might be best case scenarios, but I don't know yet. Either way the next 4 years are going to be hard financially. My income will cover rent and a little more, but not much.

retirement,"Everyone has different circumstances, tax strategies and so on, and we all are familiar with the concept of the safe withdrawal rate.  


But I am really wondering how people who have been retired for a minimum of 5 years are doing in terms of capital base (invested cash) versus after-tax, spent cash.  


in my mind, there is an abstract ratio that could be expressed as a ""yield"" for lack of a better term. For example, if the total cash amount excluding fixed assets like home equity or various trusts amounts to $100,000  - again, not the total net worth, but only the cash sitting in investment vehicles like IRA's and portfolios - if that cash is invested and the income from capital gains and distributions is (maybe partially) used for life expenses, what percentage does that come to for you?  


I'm trying to ask in such a way that people can comfortably answer this without needing to divulge anything too personal. If your investment portfolio is $10m and you fatFire on $500k per year, your ""yield"" is 5% - and if you're on a $900k living on $45k, you're also a 5%.  


Of particular interest for me in this inquiry is how things pan out at the end of the year, when everything is said and done, budgets are reconciled, maybe some of the anticipated expenditures weren't needed and got reinvested, or maybe the opposite and you had to sell equities to pay for unplanned things, raising the ""yield"".  


As you can tell, I'm not much of a finance person, don't have much in depth knowledge on details but I try to get a better grip on my financial planning. I'm simply attempting to get some real life data points from people around what' is actually viable, because just saying ""4% SWR"" just feels too generic and theoretical to me.",t2_f9iznv0e,0,"tax time - what's your actual % yield from invested cash, that you're using to fund your lifestyle?",[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,10pe3ob,True,tmrs_prof,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/10pe3ob/tax_time_whats_your_actual_yield_from_invested/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/10pe3ob/tax_time_whats_your_actual_yield_from_invested/,18939.0,1675112917,0.0,,False,1675112931,1675112931,2023-01-30 21:08:37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
retirement,"Basically, I am a self-employed independent contractor who gets Form 1099. Therefore I contribute to a SEP IRA normally.

retirement,"I am curious to understand people’s experiences with the idea that one needs 80% or 50% etc of pre-retirement income to be comfortable in retirement. 

———

TLDR: I feel like I have enough. will have $10k per month income before social security. Am I missing something?

———

I live/work in Manhattan, which is a bubble (so maybe an exception to the rule?) 

In retirement I plan to live part of the year in FL or a low cost country and part in upstate NY. 

I don’t have a pension so my income will just be my retirement savings and social security.  Without social security and not touching principal I should have about $10k per month of income (assuming 3% yield). 

I feel like this income is enough, but it is also much less than 50% of my pre-tax earnings. (In a good income year my marginal tax rate is 37 + 11 +3.8 = 51.8%, so pre-tax is a weird measure). 

My habits are not flashy. I spent on kids’ education and buying real estate over the years.  No expensive car or jewelry. Not a drinker. I mostly spend on travel.

retirement,"Hi,

I’m trying to understand this whole tax bracket situation with regards to my retirement accounts. I currently have a 401k, 403b, and a Roth. Here are some quick notes on my situation Contributions are :

Age: 32
Salary: $96k/year

401k (5.75%,) 
403b (12%)
Roth (can only put in $100/month for now) 

If I stay with my current employer until retirement my max salary would be around $130k (public school employee). I’m married so throughout the course of my career I’ll bump up into the 24% tax bracket. Once I retire though, I’d assume I’d be back down to 22% as I won’t be making as much money. 

Would it make more sense for me to have a traditional where I’m taxed at a lower bracket upon retirement? Or stick with the Roth? 

Also, do you think I should try and contribute more to my 403b before my Roth?

I’ve been trying to understand this on my own but I can’t wrap my head around it for some reason!

retirement,"A scenario we are consideting--my husband could claim @62 this yr and keep his high paying job...yes hed be losing the fra- delay-increase and 80% of the ss would be taxed as income (while also taking 21k or whatever the number is from job earnings as allowed extra income, yes?) Otoh, if i file when he does, I would also make more via lower-paid spouse benefits than i would if i file befote him by myself? So theres that factor....

retirement,"My wife and I have been planning to wait till age 70 for each of us, to maximize the SS payments. However, today I put the actual numbers into a spreadsheet and am wondering if that is the best choice. 

We are 65 and 66 years old now, and both are retired. Both in good health, for our ages. We don't have expensive lifestyles, and can survive without taking SS for now. But certainly if there were more money, I'd be happy to buy more toys. The house and cars are paid off. I calculated the possible income from SS if I started taking it now, vs at age 66.5, vs age 70. I included a yearly 4% interest addition, in case I would just save the money in a high return savings account, like Citibank or Synchrony bank. What I found is that the age 70 - delay scenario doesn't catch up to starting SS payments now until 2045, when I would be 88. Even the FRA case, starting at age 66.5 is not much better, catching up in 2044 at age 87. 

This seems a little surprising to me, since the financial advisers seem to usually advocate delaying taking SSI. Will I really make it to age 87? The insurance companies don't think so. Is there a significant impact on my wife's survivor benefit if I would delay that I should take into account? I believe her own SSI payment will be a little more than half of what mine will be, so maybe she would not take a survivor benefit if I would die before her.",t2_5hsvz,0,Another Should I take SS retirement benefit now or wait until age 70 topic - seeking opinions,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,10n16nf,True,northernguy,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/10n16nf/another_should_i_take_ss_retirement_benefit_now/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/10n16nf/another_should_i_take_ss_retirement_benefit_now/,18869.0,1674866140,0.0,,False,1674866152,1674866153,2023-01-28 00:35:40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"Don’t be fooled by retirement’s handshake with the long shadow of having fun in old age. To illustrate, I’ve had a life-saving cardiac procedure, arthritis, cataracts, hearing loss, lung scarring, and poor hand circulation. Time in old age is like compound interest on a loan. Eventually, we end up frail, sick, and dead. So how do I reconcile the prospect of kicking the bucket with feeling healthy, strong, and vibrant most of the time? I remind myself not *to* take life too seriously because nobody leaves this world alive.

My wife (age 65) and I (age 68) play competitive tennis; make occasional whoopee while the sun shines bright; participate in a book club; eat sushi with our friends; remodel our house; donate annually to local charities; and never take our general health for granted. I am grateful that our careers prospered, mostly my wife’s profession, during the last four decades, which allows us to live comfortably.

One positive byproduct of retirement is being numb to the opinion of others. If I take the garbage out, dress in my pajamas, and wear mismatched clothes in public, no problem. Why didn’t I develop this courage and vulnerability in my thirties? Today, I give hugs, ask for what I want, and give a helping hand to strangers. The result is I feel good about myself most of the time. Have you ever heard the saying - *you can't sprinkle perfume on others without getting a little on yourself?*

Being warmhearted and attentive is a value in our marriage. Recently, my wife surprised me with a soft, colorful throw for my afternoon naps on the sofa. In turn, my sleepy-head wife wakes up every morning to a cup of hot coffee on her night table. My love language is acts of kindness.

Now and then, negativity creeps into my head, tainting my perception. People seem uncaring, drivers appear rude, and life is unfair. Falling into a melancholy state can happen to anyone. Once I recognize my state of mind, I tell myself to snap out of it. Then I remind myself life is less about what happens to you and more about how we respond to it. In other words, the quality of our life is what we make it.

The twenty-first century is the greatest time to be alive, especially for older adults. We benefit from the advances in medicine and the study of seniors. For instance, gerontologists break down the three time periods so that we can maximize our lives. The research segments our vitality and ability to walk: go-go years (age 65 - 74), slow-go years (age 75–84), and no-go years (85+). Knowing this big picture motivates me to take better care of myself so that I can travel.

Up to now, we have sidestepped life-threatening illnesses like cancer, diabetes, and other life-altering injuries. We try to eat nutritious foods, drink alcohol sparingly, and exercise regularly. One underrated part of self-care is rest and sleep. After a workout, it is vital to allow your body to recover. More importantly, through regular doctors' visits, our high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and mild arthritis are controlled with medication.

At this stage of living, life is not a sprint but a very slow marathon. Having fun requires juggling work ethic (exercise and nutrition), relationships, and stimulating activities you love. I try to live with low expectations and gratitude for the little pleasures. Yes, there is an element of luck in life because health is not guaranteed. Good luck to you.",t2_qbi5jlqj,0,IS RETIREMENT FUN?

retirement,"Hi All - I'm hoping you might be able to provide some advice for my situation.  I am 56M and retired mid 2022.  I have funds in a 401k, 457, IRA and brokerage account.  All of my funds are in a 2025 target date fund (retired a few years early).  I always liked these funds because I am somewhat risk-averse.  I am not having to withdraw from these accounts, and don't see that likelihood for another 8-10 years.  Due to this, my financial advisor is suggesting moving some of my funds to something a little more growth oriented than my current target date fund.

Eliminate income tax and add 30% federal sales tax (in addition to the state sales tax) to boost the economy and pay off national debts.  Hmmmm ... from a middle class' point-of-view, let's say we make $100k per year filed jointly and we spend about $45k a year in buying stuffs. You are telling me that we don't have to pay our 22% ($12,615 based on 2023 tax brackets) of income tax, but instead we will be paying $17,212 of federal and state sales tax on our $45, 000 purchases?  Say what?  What a deal!  Sign me up!

Charging more taxes on sales will increase the economy spending.  Can someone who is a financial whiz explain this concept to me?  If I have to pay more to buy stuffs (much like inflation), I will spend less.  The less I and others spend less, the less moneys and goods move.  

Getting rid of IRS!  Great!  Now, the really rich folks will get really richer!  Paying 30%-38% sales tax is nothing but a drop in their bucket.  Now, if there is no IRS, there is no audit of tax returns.  More moneys can be had.  Wooohooo!

retirement,"I am considering my options and wanted to float this idea past you.

I am a Green Card holder, living in the US, not a US citizen. I have retired. I ended up with an IRA with $8 million. Plain IRA, not a ROTH. I do not have a ROTH IRA. I want to move back to my home country at age 80. As I understand it, I cannot keep an IRA in the USA while not a resident.

I think I need to empty the IRA over the next 13 years, pay all the taxes, and reinvest some outside the IRA. Then when the time comes, I can move what's left overseas legally, with all taxes paid, and no issues.

Assuming there is no growth in the IRA, just to simplify things, then to deplete it between now and then, means that over the next 13 years, I should take an annual distribution of $615,000, pay Federal and state taxes, live off some of it, and then reinvest the rest.

That means I take an annual $615,000 distribution, pay $163,000 Federal tax, and $35,000 Virginia tax, use $120,000 for living expenses, and have an excess of $297,000 per year which I would reinvest. After the 13 years, the IRA would be empty, I would have paid $2.1 million Federal tax, and $455k state tax, and have $3.8 million invested free and clear. I could then move that $3.8 million around the world, free and clear. Effectively, that's about a 32% tax rate, with Federal and state combined.

Yes, I know I have to pay US taxes for the rest of my days, as well as my home country's taxes. I have to submit a US tax return each year for the rest of my days. But after the money is out of the IRA, and it's reinvested, income will be generated by dividends, and sales of equities (long-term capital gains) and the tax rate would be a little lower than the 32%.

It's sort of sad to see $8 million deplete to $3.8 million, but the tax has to be paid one way or another, and I will have lived off it for those 13 years too. Still, that converts to an even better amount when moved to my home country.

Is my thinking really screwy? Are my assumptions wrong?

I brought him back to my gym with my carry-along-someone-w/u pass, and I brought him to the stair master since last time he had a hard time jogging on a treadmill. After 3 minutes he backed out and said ""i'm dead"" ""we should do this everyday"" 

I didn't feel like I got much from going to the gym but if I can help him then it makes me happy to help - And I feel bad to workout while he's just sitting there, so I try to do the same workouts as him. I've got other means anyway - at home. 

He's a chef, and he's been just working in a restaurant for about 40 years. He was a big smoker, but since covid, he would go on the patches often. Some periods he would go as long as 8 months without smoking. Then he would start again, and then he would go on the patches. He's a compulsive personality (he gambles too) so telling him that he should completely quit for life would just not work and make him miserable. So as his daughter i'm trying to help with baby steps. He's got high blood pressure (which he takes pills for) and it looks like he's got knee problems. So I'm wary about how to help him train.

retirement,"Hi all,

I just started a new job (city government - parks and rec) that and they offer a service buyback program with a pension that takes 10 years to be vested. I was initially excited about this because I didn't know such programs existed. I have about 3 and a half years of government service (same industry) that I didn't reach the vested period (spent 3 years at one municipality, 7 months at another). 

I asked to get some more information from HR/finance about the program. While they couldn't give me an exact figure until I reach out to my previous employers, they were able to give me a ballpark figure, stating that generally speaking, 3 years of service would cost between $15-25k 

Simply put, I don't have that. Even if I went the rout of paying for it over the course of 3 years through payroll, I did the math and it would cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $500/month. With a modest salary ($68k), HCOL area, and student loans, that doesn't seem like a good financial decision.

That said, I've read that you should always buy back when you can.

retirement,"I don't really expect a direct answer to my situation, but I have been trying to analyze/compute the optimum roth conversions.  I have what I think is a modestly sophisticated spreadsheet that takes into account expenses, inflation, SS, taxes, RMD's, investment returns ,etc.  I use the Excel non-linear Solver add-in the search for either the maximum end of life networth, or on the minimum taxes paid.

My intuition would say that minimizing taxes due to efficient tax conversions would also equate to maximum networth.  But the correlation is not there.  If I solve for maximum networth, it shows my plan paying  more in taxes.  But if I solve for minimum taxes paid then my end of life network is lower.

The results seem counter intuitive to me.  I have had several smart friends peer review the formulas in my model and no one has found an obvious flaw.  

I wonder if other people have examined the effectiveness of roth conversions and seen similar numbers.

retirement,"Broad question, I know.  I'll try and narrow it down.  


My wife and I are quickly approaching 2025 which will be my 20 years of service at the Fire Department and 20 years of her working/contributing to her 401k.  We both have 401k's and I will have a decent pension from the FD that kicks in January of 2025(around $100k/year).  I have the rare opportunity from a department merger to continue working and begin a new pension and will go until 2033 or 2035 with the 2nd smaller pension vested.  My wife will continue some at home businesses that should also persist through retirement.  The 2nd pension will be small or converted over to an investment plan/401k'ish thing at the end if it makes more sense as my age will incur penalties on the 2nd pension. (Currently 59 years of age/25 years of service on 2nd pension to collect with no penalties)   


Come 2025 we want to utilize my pension to lay the ground work for our place of retirement.  We want to get out of Florida where we've spent our whole lives dealing with Hurricanes and well, Florida stuff.  Plan is to bank 1/3 for our tax bill, 1/3 to pay down our mortgage a little quick(about $180k left on a now $900k'ish home?) and 1/3 to down payment on land to build on/home in a different state.  Plan is also to really retire when we retire.  I don't want to work ever again if possible., after 30 years at the FD I don't think I should need too. (I have lots of hobbies, I won't get bored, promise)  


All that being said, we are having a hard time picking a place!  


We are Florida kids and hate the cold.  We want to pick a state that has good tax laws for retirees or low enough cost of living to offset having to pay taxes on our retirement.  Florida has good retirement tax laws but cost of living here is getting out of hand.  Our taxes and insurance will be up to $13k this year from $8k/year when we bought in 2013. I'm a left leaning centrists and she's a moderate democrat and it would be nice to be in place thats kind of center too.  We also want to try and escape looming natural disasters growing up with Hurricanes our whole lives.  I've done lots of research and nothing lands on ""This is absolutely the spot for us!""  So I figured I check with my fellow redditors.  


**Have any of you found a state/city that has good/fair retiree tax laws, lower cost of living, warm enough to be outside 300+ days out of the year and doesn't have a regular threat of natural disasters?**  


At this point I am ok with anecdotal answers and then do some more targeted research of those areas.  


Right now only place on my radar is Greensville, South Carolina.  Seems very safe from hurricanes compared to South Florida.  In the foot hills of the mountains so can be at some elevation to avoid flooding.  No drought.  (Maybe risk of wild fires in the more forested areas still?I'd cut tree line way back of what we buy)  Near Clemson so a good mix of politics.

retirement,"Roth conversion, x-post

Tldr, I can't see where a Roth conversion makes much sense, can you?

Let's pretend

Let's pretend Martha is averaging $30k/yr on dividends in a non-retirement account for several years.  It would seem to make the most sense of paying tax in a roth conversion year at the 24% bracket which is upto $391k of AGI (today's tax rates, who knows if it will change).   

So I think if that logic holds true, Martha would have to accommodate for the $30k of dividends and its impact on AGI and/or make a wholesale change to the portfolio where dividends would be paid out in retirement vs non-retirement funds (that would be an ugly tax choice, more cap gains).   

In addition, Martha would need to have enough other cash to sustain living such that she is not having to cash out more stock to pay bills - which if she did that approach, it would cause cap gains which would also increase  AGI.  

Complicating things - SS at (max) age 70 and RMDs at 75 (max now).

Bottom line - it feels like a really narrow fairway to hit on a ROTH conversion for someone with that scenario.   

The benefit of doing a ROTH conversion I'm seeing really is one to heirs - they won't be forced on a 10yr RMD withdrawal schedule (under today's tax rules).

I guess the secondary benefit would be compound growth tax free - but that's only if it has time to grow - so making this kind of decision maybe before 65 would be prudent.

So feels like the window is in the down income year until 65 or time of SS withdrawal is the window to do conversions - and the window is limited by any other income Martha is bringing in the door.

This is what I found out:

\--If I continue to earn the same amount  of money that I made last year, and have those earnings for every year until I draw my benefit, those extras years of paying Social Security taxes will increase my monthly benefit by about $10 per month, compared to the benefit that I would draw if I just stopped working this year,

\--If I really set the world on fire, and somehow make twice as much money as I made in 2021, and continue to make that higher wage until I start to collect benefits, my monthly payment will go up about $100, whether I start collecting at 62, 67, and 70.

Those numbers don't seem big enough to drive the decision on when to stop paying into the system

Hello!

With this book, you can reap all the benefits of yoga without needing any special skills or equipment.

I would love to give this book to 20 people who think they could benefit from these practices (friends from the US, Canada and Australia only). To get a free PDF version of this book.

I'd like people to read the free book and provide an honest review on Amazon in the next two weeks. If you found these exercises helpful, I can't wait to hear from you! I look forward to connecting with you. I look forward to connecting.

retirement," 

I'm married 11 years (together 13 years). We both are 38.

Both my parents has passed away a long time ago, now I'm at the point I just want to go back to China to be with my grandma (whom very old). My grandma leave her house to me in my name in event of my death, all the paperworks has been done and signed, so legally that house will be mine once my grandma die (and she very old right now).

I'm from Shanghai, and Covid right now is still very bad in Shanghai, so I can't go back to China at the momment. But Covid restriction will eventually has to ease down and I plan to fly back there as soon as it ease.

I want my husband to retire early and go with me to China.

Our financial situation is very simple and straightforward. I do want to see him retire early.

\--- Husband work at his job 15 years already and has 15 years of experience in his job field and has seniority at his job. He makes 130K a year take home (that is after taxes). He always very responsible with my money, he debt-free.

I'm also debt-free, I'm a frugal wife, penny pinching even. We don't haev a financial problem, we click as we both responsible with money.

\--- Our house which he pay in cash when he bought it in 2019 when it was newly build, we are the first home owner there. We have zero mortgage, it was paid all at once in cash. Not a big house or anything, a 1700 square feet house which is enough for the two of us to live in. He also own another house (which he brought for his mom to live in) which he paid it in cash, but it a 1200 square feet.

\--- He max out both his 401ks and IRAs every year, so this not a problem.

\--- Our Savings, cash liquidity he has 650K

Yes, Chinese love cash, lol. that why you see alot of Chinese buy house and paid their house in cash.

\---- No debt of any kind, each of us have a car, and it pay off too long ago. He has perfectly driving records all his life, so cars insurance is not high at all, he is 38 and perfectly clean driving record.

\--- Our healthcare is yeah, basically pay by his job.

\---- Stuff like bills electricity gas internet trash water etc... it cheap. I'm frugal, I don't even run the heater in the winter, does run AC in the summer but only when necessary. We don't even have cable, lol.

\---- He does have a life insurance policy. Along with his retirement, 401ks and IRAs which he max out both every year, so this is not a problem.

Like I say, we both are not spenders, we live very comfortable with his 130K a year income take home.

I do want him to go with me to China as soon as this Shanghai Covid restriction ease. Last time I visit my grandma as before Covid hit. And she very old, she can't wait, and if she die, I want to be there with her too.

retirement,"My mother is 56 this year and residing in Florida. She recently received a 300,000$ inheritance from a relative who passed away. She is currently unemployed due to a car accident which left her with chronic pain. She is in the process of filing for disability but it could take another 1-3 years. She hasn't worked since 2020. That being said, her cost of living is pretty low. She owns a car outright and also owns her townhome outright with no mortgages/loans. So basically all she pays is utilities+gas+food+misc items.

The thing is-- I don't think she plans on working again, ever. She's currently living on 300,000$ in a savings account. That being said, I know this is not going to last forever. Cost of living will always go up as well as inflation.
I know she was considering investing the 300k into an s&amp;p index fund but that doesn't really solve her no income problem.

Playing around with an annuity calculator here --(https://www.schwab.com/annuities/fixed-income-annuity-calculator) --

If she were to buy a 225k annuity- for life- it would pay out somewhere between 1100-1300$ a month starting in February. She could also collect SS at 65 or 67 depending on when she chooses. The disability claim (if it ever gets approved) would just be additional monthly $$. I like the idea of her having 75k or so invested in an index or in a high interest savings account for emergencies (maybe a mix of both).

I know annuities are typically frowned upon for most people and their situations, but for her situation I believe there's no better fit to give her passive cash flow for the next 20-30 years so she can at least cover her cost of living.

retirement," 

For a lot of HENRYs, a question I see a lot online is how to properly execute a Mega Backdoor Roth, or how to get more in Roth retirement savings, even if you exceed income limits. Here is a guide my planning firm wrote on how to do it. **Keep in mind, limits mentioned in the guide use 2022 figures, not 2023 numbers. 2023 Figures are higher.**

Also, for folks nearing retirement, it may make sense to ensure your emergency cash reserve is higher in preparation for retirement. We generally like to have 1-2 years of liquid cash on hand in a retirees portfolio instead of the general 3-6 months of expenses. If pursing a Mega Backdoor Roth is going to jeopardize your emergency fund or other goals, you'll need to weigh the pros and cons/ how much to put in.

retirement,"Each year I currently do a backdoor Roth IRA contribution via a non-deductible contribution to my Trad, then convert over to a Roth IRA.

I recently learned about the ""Mega backdoor Roth IRA"" that lets you contribute significantly more.

My employer gives a generous 10% match on my standard 401k contributions. Since I do not get taxed on my employers contributions to my retirement, is it possible to convert only their contribution to the mega backdoor Roth IRA to avoid tax on the gains?

I am probably missing something but it feels like you can avoid tax on both the pre and post this way, thoughts?

retirement,"I retired end of 2022.  Last night I had a dream (nightmare?) where my boss treated one of my subordinates in a spiteful and disrespectful way, and he refused to listen to me that the team member deserved better.  In my dream I was building up more and more frustration, and then finally decided to tell my boss off, when I woke up.  For a few moments waking up, I was furious, even to the point my heart was beating faster.  

Then I realized that it was just a dream, I'm retired, I don't have to put up with that B.S. anymore...  A feeling of peace washed over me.  

I hope that's the last of work dreams, in early retirement I'm just starting to understand how much stress I was dealing with at work.  As a natural introvert, I had to do a lot of flexing to become a successful supervisor, but eventually it became exhausting.  Damn it feels good to escape corporate workplace drama, the pettiness of ego inflated bosses, and the myriad issues that come from supervising a bunch of people.

retirement,"I wish I knew how to post a link to someone else's post on this because there is a very good one from two years ago.  If you search ""DAF"" on this sub you will find it.

What I wanted to say about DAF it is slightly different.  As we approach retirement, we are in our highest earning years at the top of our careers and making the most money we ever have.  So we created a DAF as part of our retirement strategy.  This isn't for everyone, but this is how it works for us:

The DAF is an investment account you set up, that is a charitable giving account.  So we created our own little philanthropic foundation.  Let's say our highest earning year combined was $250,000 and we knew this would be our biggest tax year ever.  We set it up in that year and wrote a check to our foundation for $20,000.  That was an immediate tax write off.

Going forward, as we budget for retirement we do not have to budget for charitable giving which is really important to us.  Now that money is parked in an account where we can write checks from it to our charities.  And the money grows tax free as well.  So you or your investment advisor invest it and you decide how you want to money to be paid out to charities for the remainder of your life.

As we focus on a budget that we can live on in retirement this was one of my favorite money saving tips so I thought I would share it here.",t2_a3k5xf25,0,Donor Advised Fund (DAF) - Important strategy for retirement for those who give,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,10cqj25,True,HipAboutTime,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/10cqj25/donor_advised_fund_daf_important_strategy_for/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/10cqj25/donor_advised_fund_daf_important_strategy_for/,18605.0,1673806331,0.0,,False,1673806348,1673806349,2023-01-15 18:12:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"I am 66 and mostly enjoy my job in public education. I’ve been doing it for over 22 years and have gotten pretty good. I work 10 hour days 4 days a week 9 months each year. During this time my “leadership” or administration has changed completely 7 times. Every time admin changes it creates new procedures, processes, etc.  I mention this because that is the most exhausting part of my job. There is a trend that after about 4 years in power our leadership basically loses their minds, start making crazy rules and procedures and is forced out for new leadership. Currently this is year 5 of current leadership and I am seeing the cracks. I have been toying with retiring in June of 2023. Several of my colleagues are retiring. There is a shortage of people with my degree (which is required to do my job) and I am apprehensive about what my work load would look after June 2023. On the other hand, if I hold out until 2024 I will be in a much better financial position. Part of me says 1 year won’t *really* make much difference financially. I would have the house paid off and that makes me feel much more secure. I tell myself I can simply take things as they come in the 23/24 school year, as I will be gone after that. I also worry about having a stressful unhappy year which will taint my happy feelings of a successful career and happy retirement.

retirement,"I’m in my mid 20’s and just learned about Roth IRA retirement funds a couple years ago. (yes I wish I knew when I was 18)

Anyway, I opened my first Roth IRA through Primerica about 2 years ago. Last year I started a Roth IRA account with the Acorns app, and just recently I started a Roth IRA through the Robinhood app. 

My plan is;

Primerica Roth IRA: $250/month
Robinhood Roth IRA: $100/month
Acorns Roth IRA: $50/month

(Unfortunately I don’t make enough money to max out my roth ira contributions after all my living expenses/bills)

The robinhood app matches 1% of your contribution which makes it unique from the other accounts, and Ive been a big fan of the Acorns app. I seem to get really good returns from it.

retirement,"So I know the longer you wait to claim, the more money per month you will receive. The breakeven age is roughly 78. In the following scenario, why would I wait until FRA?

Married couple, same age, both in good health. Our temptation is to begin taking the money earlier so that we can use it while we're in good health. We don't necessarily need it to live--we'll have a pension and have plenty of retirement assets. By taping into SS early, we would leave all of those retirement funds untouched until RMDs.

So let's assume I begin collecting at age 62. I'm the lower wage earner. My monthly SS payment is $1980. From 62-78, I would earn $380,160. At 67, my monthly payment is $2813. From 67-78, I would earn $371,316.

So why would I wait? My spouse makes more, but the same scenario as above basically applies.

I understand delaying the higher earner in order to guaranteed a larger survivor benefit, but I'm confused (or maybe not) about the benefit of waiting until FRA.

retirement,"In 2019 when I retired, I had to start buying my own Health Insurance. At that time the Premium was $1250 per month for my wife &amp; I.

It has increased each year, and this year has increased to $1720 per month. So about $100 increase per year.

I didn't account / budget for Insurance to increase so much so aggressively. 

Is this normal? Due to Inflation? We are healthy and do not smoke or have any medical issues thankfully. No Kids. We do have the highest BCBS PPO plan available with a $750 deductible. But was told the increases are not related to us, it's what the insurance pays out as a whole. We have BCBS and our state does not have any other options to shop around with.

Should I expect my health insurance to continue to go up at this rate? Trying to budget. 

We are in our Mid 40's. So should I expect to pay roughly a $100 increase each year?

retirement,"I see frequent questions here of people comparing themselves to what financial writers say.

It is important to note that there are no hard set rules. Every personal situation is different.

At my job I frequently had to answer the question ""what will it take to do x?"" My answer was ""you want the 5 seconds answer, the 2 days answer or the 6 months answer?"" The 5 seconds was based on previous experience and could be ""between 1 and 2 million"" or ""1 to 5 people"" or ""between two months an a year"". For the 2 days answer I would have to do some research. For the 6 months, I may have to assemble a team to get to a clearer answer.

Think that all these ""rules"" are to give the 5 second answer to the ""how much should I save?"" Question.

There is:

- ""You'll need 70% of your income in retirement"". Well, if you live OK with 40% of income before retirement and your expenses won't change substantially, then given lower taxes, less than 40% gross will do. Note that 70% is not because you'll spend less, it's just because now you won't need to put x% in savings and your tax rate will be lower.

- ""If you withdraw 4%/3%/whatever%, on first year and adjust for inflation, it will last"". Well. It depends on a particular mix of investments. There are more conservative and more risk tolerant people. Some people have an expected short longevity, others a short one, etc. The truth is that we don't have a crystal ball so you need to review your finances frequently and adjust.

- ""You need to save 25x your annual expenses"". This comes from the same place as the 4% rule so same comments apply.

- And many others.

These rules always have some embedded assumptions. Different risk tolerance, country tax rules, retirement benefits, regional cost of living, family situation, expected longevity, lifestyle, etc. may substantially change the answer.

So, these rules help you focus on answering the question, However, you need take them with a grain of salt and see how the assumptions apply to you personally.",t2_f560er8,0,Retirement savings' guidelines,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,1095149,True,rarsamx,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/1095149/retirement_savings_guidelines/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/1095149/retirement_savings_guidelines/,18511.0,1673444628,0.0,,False,1673444643,1673444643,2023-01-11 13:43:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not the kind of nightmares I had while I was working, but more generalized anxiety dreams set in a more generalized place called ""work."" Mostly modeled after my last job, but more focused on... Running and running and never being able to find where they had moved the coffee shop in the building. Going to visit and not a single person from when I had worked there was still there, and while all the new people were bright and capable and lovely, they knew nothing a out my and mycolleague's Era of work, all our accomplishments had been forgotten. (That seems like a clear retirement anxiety dream!) I also dreamt that my most recent boss came out as...Trans...at that moment poised between what was and what would be...and I was overwhelmed by surprise.

retirement,"Hi there! I’m posting this on behalf of my father as his daughter. 

My dad is 55 and has no retirement plan or savings. He owns a house but based on conversations he mentioned still owing a large amount (assuming he means well into his 60s or 70s). But my concern really lies in him not having any form of retirement savings accounts. As a 23 year old who just landed my first “real” job I am just now understanding and learning about 401k, Roth IRAs, HYSA and setting this up for myself. But, I’m learning all this for the first time and I’m trying my best to explain to my dad that he should set this up now. Problem being, my dad is very cautious and wary about putting his money into something (especially now in this economy). But I’m convinced it’s more so that he’s never really known what options he has. We are and have grown up as a low income first generation household - with no experience or relatives who can help us navigate retirement planning or investments and such. I’ve just now convinced him to open a HYSA to keep about 15k that he’s just had sitting in his checkings (I know that’s just the bare minimum) and to discuss his 401k options with his employer. I know since he’s only starting at 55 he needs more. I’m doing my own research but I see conflicting options for opening an IRA at his age. Would a traditional or Roth IRA be better? His income most likely won’t increase significantly through the remainder of his career and most likely stay in the lowest tax bracket. I see that’s one of the most common ways to decide but I’d like to know if there’s anything else to consider. I’m hoping to convince him to open an ira and place the max 7k that he can and then add rest to the HYSA. Is that wise? Idk. If you’ve read this far- thank you so much! This isn’t only helpful for him but also for myself as I learn how to navigate all this.

Again I just feel like I’m missing out, I turn 60 in 2 months, and hate to see life wasted. We have no friends here in FLA.

retirement,"I am in a situation where I really don't need money at 36 years old. I inherited a paid off house, car is paid off, I have next to no bills, and I don't buy much. Everything is paid off. I currently have $13,000 in my bank and it's growing about $2k a month at this point. However, I have $0 in my 401k (opted out my whole life). 

So for now, I've set my 401k to 10% of my income (employer matches up to 6%). According to a retirement calculator, putting 10% of my income in a 401k instead of keeping money in my bank will result in roughly 83% more money if I retired at 65. That is a significant difference... Does that seem accurate..?

If so, given the fact I am behind in my 401k for my age, I am wondering if it would just be wise to start putting \~50% of my income into it. I'd still be adding roughly $1,000/month to my savings in the bank, while adding a large amount to my 401k. Personally, I feel like this is a good plan until I reach about $50,000 in savings, after which I planned to start putting closer to 80% of my income into a 401k.

retirement,"Now that I know I can access my super in an allocated pension due to meeting requirements (60F - finished a work arrangement), I’m finding it challenging working out which one is best, or even limiting my choices to a couple. 

I notice that Scott Pape (aka The Barefoot Investor) uses Hostplus Balanced Index fund for his super, however, his is in accumulation phase. 

I am wondering if others think the same Hostplus choice, but in an allocated pension option, is a worthwhile consideration?

I have an AustralianSuper accumulation account and their fees seem pretty high for their allocated pension account where one can select one’s own investments (ie ETFs). 

I also have a GESB West State super account, however, their allocated pension options don’t include being able to choose ETFs. 

I don’t have to have ETFs. I’m not a financial whizz, although I’ve definitely come a long way on my financial literacy journey of late (thanks to this forum and YouTube!). 

I am still working part time, although not in great need of the compulsory 2% (possibly 4% from July 2013) withdrawal, but could redeposit into accumulated super, if desired.

It is understood that as you near retirement, you should increase your cash cushion so that you can weather market downturns without having to sell your securities at a significant loss.  

What *specific* criteria are people using to determine how they make the decision on which accounts to dip into?  I have enough cash reserves to withstand 3 or 4 years of poor returns, assuming I wanted to deplete my savings completely before hitting my taxable or 401(k) accounts.  Having no cash on hand for emergencies doesn't sound very attractive, since that would then require a sale regardless of the market conditions if a real emergency arose.

So how are the rest of you deciding when the market is ""good enough"", assuming that it hasn't recovered fully to a previous high, like we are in today?  It feels a whole lot like market timing.

retirement,"A bunch of my CDs matured over the last couple of months but I still have a few mone in one of my banks and I'm a little confused on how the penalty works.

retirement,"Ravishing Redditors: 

I’m 55 and current goal is to work full time for two years if I can stand it. Between now and then, I’m committed to visiting places to which I may want to return for short-to-medium term stints. I envision quitting full time work and having a more leisurely work/life balance by consulting (mostly virtually) from whichever country it is. I’m a really good expert in my field, and while working full time now, I’m writing and publishing when I can and have some side-hustle consulting. Hope is to build my brand so I can generate biz once in out. 

Ideally, I’m just turning 57 when I walk away and start a new adventure. I’d like to build it to where I can live outright on consulting income and let retirement funds continue to grow (knowing I can tap as needed but it’s better to wait til 59.5). 

The sad truth is that America’s deplorable healthcare system will drive me away for a while. I hear horror stories about ACA, plus I’d just like to try something new while I’m in good health. I could eventually return to the US (plan for now is to rent out my condo in VHCOL east coast city). 

I know Mexico has a very simple 180-day tourist visa. Other countries may as well. I’m fascinated that Finland is aggressively pursuing people.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, which was passed by Congress on December 23, 2022, and is expected to be signed by President Biden, includes a change in age for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, governmental 457(b) plans, and IRAs.

Below are highlights of this change:

* The new law increases the RMD age from 72 to 73 beginning January 1, 2023.
* If you will turn 72 in 2023 you are not required to take your first RMD until 2024.

retirement,"I’m retired.  MrsOM isn’t.  Her current job may go away in the next few weeks and she has already identified several new remote opportunities.

Assuming everything falls into place, we’d like to begin traveling.  The idea is to start with a month outside the US.  If her new position allows it, no problem. She’ll work there and take vacation.  

If it doesn’t, I’ll leave a week ahead of her, get established, she’ll travel, stay two weeks, return home and I’ll follow a week later.  Once she retires, we may extend the travel time from a month to several months.  That depends on how we age.

We’ll start where we have a small edge.  We have a close friend from Croatia who already has a place we can rent.  Another friend and former co-worker lives in Budapest so that’s a possibility.  MrsOM is from Brazil so Portugal is a good possibility.  We both love Belgium and I have a friend who has an apartment there that’s empty nine months out of the year.  That’s a possibility.

Part of what confuses me is the conventional wisdom that you should budget for 80% of pre-retirement salary. This seems high to me. I would assume when I retire my house should be paid off, I won't have any other debt other than maybe a car payment (even that is unlikely), I'm not commuting to work, and my kids are out of the house (or paying me rent lol).

Both my parents has passed away a long time ago, now I'm at the point I just want to go back to China to be with my grandma (whom very old). My grandma leave her house to me in my name in event of my death, all the paperwork has been done, so technically legally I can live in that house whenever I want to go back to China.

Now my husband situation. We currently live in Texas. I been a housewife eversince married to him 11 years ago.

Our financial situation is very straightforward.

\--- Husband work at his job 15 years already and has 15 years of experience in his job field, he has seniority there. He makes 130K a year take home (that is after taxes). He always very responsible with my money, he debt-free. 

I'm also debt-free, I'm a frugal wife, penny pinching even. We don't haev a financial problem, we click as we both responsible with money. 

\--- He has a house which he pay in cash when he bought it in 2019 when it was newly build, we are the first home owner there. We have zero mortgage, it was paid all at once in cash. Not a big house or anything, a 1700 square feet house which is enough for the two of us to live in (I never wanted kids).

\--- He max out both his 401ks and IRAs every year, so this not a problem.

\--- Our savings, let just say the cash liquidity is no less than our house.

\---- No debt of any kind, each of us  have a car, and it pay off too. He has perfectly driving records all his life, so cars insurance is not high at all, he is 38 and perfectly clean driving record. 

\--- Our healthcare is yeah, basically pay by his job.

\---- Stuff like bills electricity gas internet trash water etc... it cheap. I'm frugal, I don't even run the heater in the winter, does run AC in the summer but only when necessary.

\---- He does have a life insurance policy. Along with his retirement, 401ks and IRAs which he max out both every year.

Like I say, we both are not spenders, we live very comfortable with his 130K a year income take home.

retirement,"So, I'm folloiwng posts on this sub and seeing people talking about how $1million probably isnt enough for retirement and its baffling to me. I'll put down my numbers I've done in a spreadsheet based on my expenses living in Connecticut. By retirement at age of 55 we will own our home and cars.

All expenses for both my wife and I = $2600/month. Medial insurance for both my wife and I = $1100/month. I'll figure in an additonal $500/month emergency

So absolute total expenses when we retire at 55yrs old = $4200/month

At age 62 we can collect $3800/month SS according to the .gov SS site. So we will need to bridge the gap between age 55 and 62 of $50,200/year X 7 years = $351,400 dollars needed to retire at age 55. Throw in maybe an extra $50k for a new shared car and some extra misc. expenses so lets just round it to $400k total....

I understand inflation, but some minimal investments should easily offset this.

Am I doing something incorrect with my math or am I missing an someting drastic to cost an extra $600k in extenses to hit the magical $1million+ needed to retire??

I have a lot of medical issues that only seem to be getting worse and we would like to retire around 55 years old to enjoy whatever healthy years I may have left.

retirement,"Hello! I am a yoga teacher and I wrote a book specifically for retired folks to enjoy yoga- whether you are fully mobile and just enjoy staying on the couch, or you're less mobile and need alternate ideas to keep healthy, start a rewarding hobby, and get some peace of mind. With this book, you can reap all the benefits of yoga without needing any special skills or equipment.

I would love to give this book to 20 people who think the exercises could benefit them (folks from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia only). To get the free PDF copy of the book:

retirement,"I've just recently retired -- for the second time, sort of. I've been musing about what might be the next 30-40 years of my life (my family is very long-lived though of course you never know), and wondering about others' thoughts and experiences.

So much of my focus for much of my career was on making sure I would have enough money in retirement -- and I do. Now, part of me feels like the 17-year-old with dreams and wide-ranging interests, the 25-year-old who loved crafts of all kinds and actually quit the career track for a couple of years to work as a seamstress. This part feels like this is my chance now, to reinvent myself and do those things that I used to love, those things that got pushed to the back burner as I was swept away in stressful jobs. 

I watched the Four Stages of Retirement TED Talk at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMHMOQ\_054U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMHMOQ_054U), and I've been in Stage 3 since I ""semi-retired"" about 4 years ago. I bought a business and ran for my local Assembly and then served on the Assembly during the Covid years -- THAT was a challenge. I've got two more years in office. I do have a tendency to take on too much and then work like crazy to live up to my responsibilities. Though I did Just sell my share in my business; hence my retirement. :) 

Right now I am working every day on catching up on so many things that have been delayed or postponed for all of these years, clearing the shed and clearing the garage and emptying the storage unit and getting rid of all of this STUFF. But I also have this feeling -- this is my chance to rethink and reinvent my life. I journal every day and that is a good opportunity to play with this thought, but I wonder about others and your experiences on this journey. Much of my career has been spent as a public servant and now on the Assembly and I'm in Rotary, so I am very in touch with ways of helping others; in a way my seeking is how to help myself be the best person I can for these years.

retirement,"Hi all,

I'm 67 and in the fortunate position of having enough money in my portfolio not to worry about running out whenever I decide to take SS.  I'm past Full Retirement Age, so it is a matter of waiting until 70 or taking it sooner.  I am thinking of taking it very soon and my thinking is outlined below.  If there are errors in my thinking I would appreciate them being pointed out.

My major reasons for not waiting despite the 8% annual delayed credits and being in good health...

I am single, so there is no concern about an income stream for a partner.  

There is a net present value of money which is discussed very little in the decision debate.  At a minimum money you take now can be invested safely and somewhat inflation-proofed with 20 year TIPS, so it's not really a full 8% difference you get by waiting.  

More aggressively, if I am assured of this income, I can shift my allocation to more equity away from bonds and over the course of 20 years (likely) do better than the additional SS return when considering my overall portfolio.  

Even if I decide not to get more aggressive, the extra income now will make me feel emotionally better about spending more money now on trips, etc.

Ignoring reinvestment and just looking at absolute difference in the check, if I am fortunate to live well into my 90s the absolute difference of not waiting starts to mount up.  But, that difference only starts to happen in my mid 80s and it is not overall a very significant amount even at 90.  I won't need extra money at that advanced age and even if I'm alive, my ability to spend it on fun things will have likely declined by declining health.  

And, if I am not fortunate and die earlier, it definitely paid off to have taken it sooner.  

Finally, I'd feel better about already receiving benefits as the politicians finally make changes to SS.  The group actually feeling cuts will be the most vocal and active.  And, if politicians go the nuclear option, with cross the board cuts, it will have definitely been better to take it earlier

Again, thoughts on my thoughts are most appreciated.

retirement,"My wife and I are 56 y/o and plan to retire at 62.  My pension at our SS's will cover our expenses pretty easily, barring some type of financial disaster.  We are contributing to pre-tax retirement accounts but don't have them maxed out.  Our retirement savings should mainly cover extra things we want to do while we are in our 60's and then cost-of-living increases as we get older (state pension has no COLAs).

Most of our post-tax savings just goes into a HYSA.  I have been investing a few hundred each month post-tax into some ETF's.  I know we're not talking about a lot of money here, but I am wondering if this is silly since we don't have our pre-tax contributions maxed, and we are just a few years away from being able to access funds from previous employers if we needed them for something.  We still owe the Feds tax money every April (and I have extra taken out of my check each month in withholding), so more pre-tax contributions would help chop that down more.  OTOH, it's nice to think that we have access to the ETF money now if we needed it, although obviously this is not a great time to cash out money from stock accounts.  I guess I'm wondering whether I am just playing with this ETF money or whether there is some practical rationale for saving a little this way when we're so close to 59-1/2.

Regarding taxes - I have looked at the numbers and don't really see how we will be in a higher tax bracket after we retire unless there are increases to the tax brackets, which of course could happen.",t2_bsb0p,0,"If You're Approaching Retirement, Do You Still Invest in Stocks With After-Tax Income?",[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,101iofh,True,BamaDave,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/101iofh/if_youre_approaching_retirement_do_you_still/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/101iofh/if_youre_approaching_retirement_do_you_still/,18297.0,1672681700,0.0,,False,1672681719,1672681720,2023-01-02 17:48:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"Hi all, I am turning 35, no kids. So far I have about $120,000 in retirement and also have a job with a pension. I have no debt, I am paying for a second masters but I pay tuition as I go along and have 2 semesters left/15k) I have zero debt and my home is paid off. It’s an older home so is in need of cosmetic remodel but I’ve kept up the important things (roof, necessary repairs) and figure I can do the cosmetic stuff with cash over the years. As is condition I can sell for 400k in my area of California. 

I have $100,000 in liquid cash which is my emergency fund…I may also need a new car soon as mine has 250,000 miles and I am starting to see some issues. 

I took a huge salary cut this year, went from 160k to 105k in search of better work-life balance. 

Internal debate: wait another year to put in 401 and Roth as I will need to pay off upcoming tuition of 15k and save for a car.

I know most would say 100k is unnecessary but I love the peace of mind it gives. I had a complete burn-out at work and having that emergency fund let me resign before I even had a new job lined up. 

I guess with this new job, between living expenses and saving for Roth/401 I’ll likely only have $1,500 left over each month which barely will pay for college. Not to mention I’ll need a new car sometime soon. 

On the other hand, I realize value of compound interest and hate missing out on it.

retirement,"My Aunt's husband passed away last year, which forced her into retirement. Last year of course was the worse year to retire, given sequence of returns risk.

I've been going over her financials and have concluded that due to sequence of returns risk she ought to be working until her portfolio bounces back. If she can hold off on the withdrawals from her portfolio for even 1-2 years, it would be helpful. She claims that she has cut spending to the bone and that the only way to further reduce spending would be to sell the house and get a different house that had less on-going expenditures. But now is a crappy time to sell real estate, and she also loves the house.

Would anyone here have any suggestions on some kind of full/part time job that would be relatively easy on an older woman? She says she doesn't like the idea of doing retail, driving, or anything too physically demanding. I suppose if those are the only options then she won't have much of a choice.

She like plants and gardening. So I figured she could get some job in a nursery, but she is at that age where it is now painful to squat and lift things. Otherwise she is healthy and can walk around.

There are some smaller ones with under 100 k each.  Some of there are down about 5K over the time we have had them. My wife and I still work and we pay a lot of income tax because we are salaried.

So here’s the question: Would it be a good idea to sell some of the losers?  If I sell 3 funds and take a total loss of 20K, can I reduce my income tax burden?

It’s confusing because I just read that only up to 3K can be deducted (not 20K).

retirement,"Hi,  I'll just bullet point some things to help you get a better overview of the situation:

- I'm 27, living with my girlfriend in northern England
- House is paid off
- 1 years wage on S&amp;S ISA (not great atm 🥹) 
- Both just quit job to go travelling for a couple of months
- I've got enough cash to make it through the year with no change to lifestyle, but obviously cutting back on nonessentials due to no income.

I plan to start a small business towards the end of next year, this will then become (hopefully) a reliable income.


Are there any things that I should absolutely do, sign up for, reduce over the course of the next year? 

-Currently going to sell my partners car as we won't be driving to work etc
- Ive been pretty good with matched being so I'll pick that up again

retirement,"My parents divorced after 40 years a few years back.  My mom was a stay at home mom, and both my parents are horrible with money and currently don't have a pot to piss in. No alimony. 

I'm in my mid 40s now,  divorced my cheating ex-huband 12 years ago (after being a stay at home mom for 10 years). I had to reinvent myself from nothing, was a single mother for years and worked full time while graduating college, and now currently make a decent living.  

Both my children are grown and are out of the house. 

I had a short, disastrous second marriage 2 years ago and am currently single.  

I also have 3 other siblings. 

3 years ago, my mom just moved herself into my house without asking.  She does cook and clean,  which I am grateful for.  

She refuses to work because she's NOT ""punching a timecard"" and has basically lived off of me for 3 years. (It's a whole thing... she's so stubborn and gaslights you if you try to bring it up.  It's not worth it. )

She was a housewife all her life,  so she gets almost nothing from social security. She's 66 and also not in the best health (she's not feeble or something. She's completely mobile and functional,  but I couldn't see her standing for long periods).  Plus, she's late to everything and makes excuses,  so I couldn't even see her holding a job. I also don't want to have my mom get some terrible degrading job either (ageism is a thing).

In short,  I'm ready to live alone. I'd like to start dating again and have my privacy. I've killed myself raising my kids and would like to have some time to myself. 

 It's not looking like any siblings or family members are able or willing to help. I feel guilty about wanting to be alone, I'm not going to kick my mom out on the streets. 

She's got terrible credit, history of bankruptcy and makes less than $250/month from SS. She just obsesses over government conspiracies all day on the internet. 

Are there any government programs to help me find a free senior apartment and government assistance for her? I'm in Florida.

retirement,"I am debating whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or both. I am under the income limits to receive the full deduction on the traditional side and I am also eligible to contribute to the Roth IRA.

I am 23 and currently in the 12% marginal tax bracket and expect to be in the same marginal tax bracket when I retire. However, I also believe that tax rates will be increasing in the future so I would expect my marginal tax rate in retirement to be higher than 12%. As a result, I have been primarily contributing to a Roth and am leaning on continuing that; however, I'm a bit confused on whether I should be looking at future marginal or effective tax rates.

The wisdom that I've heard is to compare your current marginal tax rate with your future retirement marginal tax rate to determine whether you should go Roth or Traditional. Wouldn't it make more sense to compare the current marginal rate to the future effective rate given that any contribution now is at the marginal rate while withdrawals will be taxed from the bottom up (i.e. some at 10%, some at 12%). Therefore, the effective tax rate would be more accurate representation of the cost/savings? This would suggest that going with traditional would be a bit better since I would expect that my effective tax rate in retirement will be lower than my current marginal rate (assuming no huge increase in tax rates). 

Any wisdom/advice is appreciated!",t2_u8ci1x79,0,Marginal or effective tax rates?,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,ztefon,True,stormblazer-33,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/ztefon/marginal_or_effective_tax_rates/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/ztefon/marginal_or_effective_tax_rates/,18061.0,1671799645,0.0,,False,1671799656,1671799657,2022-12-23 12:47:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"For several years now I have been developing a Google Sheet (.gsheet) to easily analyze the transaction data that can be exported from third-party apps (e.g. Mint and Personal Capital) and extract more value from it. I am sharing the base functionality below so anyone can use it to build on top of it. Some features:

* Setup should take less than 2 minutes.
* Tens of metrics and statistics are calculated on top of the transaction data.
* Clean and efficient tables and charts are ready for your analysis.
* All output in the spreadsheet is fully accessible. You can add on top of it to create your own custom spreadsheet and link it to other Google Apps (Drive, Gmail, Forms, Data Studio).

Doing deep dives into my transaction data was a game-changer for my financial habits and my personal FI journey. I hope you find it useful as well. You can download your personal copy [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LtexLmxJTIR7Mj-1FU6DyZzbZwyJFEfGfZNV_aSVYpI/edit?usp=sharing) (File &gt; Make a Copy). Happy holidays!

&amp;#x200B;

If you find this Google Sheet helpful and are interested in expanded functionality (but you are not interested in developing it yourself!), the Google Sheet shared above is just one of the components of the Financial Independence (FI) Spreadsheet. The FI Spreadsheet supplements third-party capabilities deals with some of its shortcomings, and tracks financial goals/ progress via a wide array of high-quality visualizations, metrics, and stats. If interested, I am selling it via Etsy ([here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1073543900/financial-independence-spreadsheet-6-in?ref=shop_home_active_1&amp;pro=1)) and I will be running a promotion (20% - Code: DECSALE) for the sub for the holidays. A detailed installation and user guide is included. Please feel free to check it out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heAc7KYc9bms7MOAIki9X0qiTP8Y5h1N/view). Please let me know what you think. Also, please let me know if there is interest in any other features that I can add.

retirement,"Please make sure you are fully informed regarding what your financial advisor is costing you.  I got rid of mine about a year and a half ago when I realized how much I was paying him. He charged me the routine one percent management fee annually.  On top of that, I was paying a commission on every purchase. In addition to that he had me in pretty high load funds where I paid .5 to 1.5%.  When I did the math, it turned out I was paying about 3% a year.  If you follow the 3% rule, that means he got the 3% that I could safely take out of my accounts with nothing left for me.  We always wondered why he sent us such a nice and expensive Christmas gift each year. Now we know.

retirement,"My dad will be retiring at 65. He won’t be retiring rich but it seems like he wants to get his 401k up to a million by 70 (won’t sell any of it) and will have a condo worth around 350,000. He will have a small pension and SS. As a son, I’m very concerned dementia is right around the corner for my father and my mother can barely walk and has heavy health problems. Yawns when she wakes up, at 12 pm, at 3 pm, at 5 pm. Type 2 diabetics, muscular dystrophy. She recently tried to get in bed and tripped and got knocked out. My dad is a poor mouth and refuses to invest any money into my mothers diet, workout plans and won’t even buy her a scooter even though she can’t walk more than 5 steps. My question is, what likely happens in this scenario? What type of collision course are we looking at here?

retirement,"I retired from the University of California In July. I was a staff, not academic. It has been a pretty horrible experience. If you want to talk to a human you have to wait on hold. I waited 5 hours once. The call back option is hit or miss. The humans I have talked to all give different info so you can’t tell which info is true. They told me everything was fine with my domestic partner and don’t need to fill out any forms and then later told me he doesn’t get any benefits because I didn’t fill out paperwork. They took 4 months to give me my first pension check but didn’t take out money for health insurance so now I have to pay an arbitrary little bit extra every month to make up for it. Why not let me just pay it off? They never told me how much my health insurance would be. They have some charts on UCNet that are approximates but there’s not enough info on them to calculate your own estimate. I did get a human estimate once but the difference in what he told me and what I actually pay is about $700/month. Suddenly an estimator widget has appeared on the website but I get different amounts on different days. Oh and I learned the hard way to always fax documents never mail them or email them. My partner and I want to get married so I’ve gotten 3 opinions on whether or not he will lose his health and survivor benefits and one of them said he will lose everything and two said he just fills out a form and everything continues. I’m scared to get married now. What’s better? Protecting his UC health insurance which seems arbitrarily and capriciously given, or ensuring I keep the house and get his social security if he dies? (I know the answer.) It’s been pretty horrible as far as bureaucracies go.

retirement,"I've watched my 401k lose $60,000 due to the market conditions. This is 27% of its value and 5 years of contributions or a quarter of my work life. We're not even in whatever recession we're supposed to be in, right? People talk about saying how you should not withdraw, which I'm not trying to do, though I would have lost less in taxes doing so when I was first spooked about this a couple years ago. This money would be better off sitting in a bank account with 0% interest than it currently is and maybe even better in an account that actually pays a small amount of interest.

I'm paying $100 a month for my retirement fund to continue to lose more and more money when I could be earning thousands in a small 1% interest account.

If a recession hits this will likely drop another 25%. Then, I would have lost a decade of my working life. How is it good advice to say to weather the storm? You mean work another extra ten years longer than I would have needed to to get back to where I would have been? When market conditions are favorable it's pretty easy to make money in the market when everything is going up and much more difficult during bear markets.

Is there a way I can freeze my retirement and move the money somewhere without it being a withdrawal and having to pay some retirement fund that continues to lose my money?

retirement,"Looking for input on my situation as I consider pulling the trigger. I'm married and 51 years old. We own our home outright and have no debt. We live in a HCOL area and don't want to move; annual property taxes are $6k. Net worth is around 3.5M, slightly more than half of which is in taxable accounts. My wife has an independent business that makes many multiples of my salary as a software developer for much less work, and it doesn't take a lot of her time, so she wants to keep ""making hay while the sun shines"". I've lost enthusiasm for work, and am debating between finding a new employer, switching to independent contract/consulting work, taking a hiatus from working, or just retiring. We've agreed we're fine with losing my healthcare benefits given the availability of the exchange, though we would not qualify for subsidies. 

We have enough money saved for our kids to attend college and are not concerned with leaving an inheritance. I've found it difficult to track our expenses because there is a lot of co-mingling of my wife's business expenses with our personal stuff, and she has partial reimbursements for things coming in from her customers. We did, however, spend one year living on only my income (\~100k about 5 years ago) by directing all of her money to a separate account, and that was totally adequate.

My wife REALLY wants me to go the hiatus route starting next spring so that we can travel (she can mostly work remotely) with our kids before they head to college. She also suggests I get a benefits job (UPS/Costco) if I do decide to work again after the proposed 1 year hiatus. I'm really afraid that once I take a year off, I'll never want to go back, especially to a ""McJob"" type situation (I've gotten a bit spoiled).

retirement,"I’m currently 24 years old, I would like to retire early or live off passive income and hobby like side hustles after initial first retirement . 

I currently have NZ$180k in savings, no assets, and a $50k student loan (will pay back minimum as it’s interest free). No other. 

I currently earn NZ$4-5k a week after tax, but let’s say $4k to be safe and no housing bills. Starting next year, I will increase my income by another $800-1k a week.

If I were frugal, I estimate that I can save around $120-140k a year in pure cash. 

Obviously letting it sit in bank is the worst idea. What are various options and steps I can take for early retirement? I would like to by 35, with at least todays money if $150k+ a year to spend during retirement. 

At the moment, my only plan is to buy a mortgage sale house at the end of next year, continue living with my mum, and have renters repay the mortgage.

retirement,"I have been following this group for awhile and I am interested in some feedback on my wife and I’s current strategy.  I feel like we do not have enough saved for our age.  Below is our financial picture

Male - 38
Female -37
Male salary - $116,000
Female salary - $92,000

I currently have a car payment of $560 that ends in May 2023.  Wife is car payment free.  I think she can make it another 3-4 years without a new car / car payment.  I think I can easily make it another 5.

Wife’s. current retirement savings $110,000
My retirement savings are $160,000

We both took good sized hits this year with the market. 

We have about $180,000 equity in our home. 

My current contribution is 13%. split between 401k and IRA

Wife’s contribution is 6% however my wife also contributes 4% to a VA pension.  She is in her first year at the VA but really likes it, so let’s assume she retires from the VA.

FERS Pension Calculation
High-3 Salary average X Creditable Years of Service X Multiplier = Gross Annual
Pension

Wife has about $60,000 cash which uses to add $6,000 a year to an IRA.  This is essentially our emergency fund and not in the market.  We are thinking about putting half of this in the market.

Investments are mostly equity index funds like voo, vti, spy etc.

We each have a whole life insurance policy / annuity worth $100,000.  This costs us around $300 a month.  I would like to keep this as a fall back option on equity withdrawals in retirement during down years. 

We have no children and do not plan on having children.

I will more than likely inherit $500,000 or so when both parents die.  Both parents are still alive.

Wife will more than likely inherit $150,000 when both parents die, both are still alive.  
 
Retirement goals include living somewhere warm such as Florida, Mexico, Dominican Republic. We would also like to be able to travel internationally once or twice a year.

retirement,"I live in the desert southwest and my plan was to retire here, either Phoenix or Las Vegas, in the next 2-3 years. I had three rental properties here that I planned to use for income, which would be a good portion of my retirement income. But, this year I decided that with the prospect of the southwest actually running out of water I am not sure this is a very smart plan anymore. I guess up until a couple years ago the idea of this area literally running out of water seemed kind of extreme, or so far in the future that ""they"" would figure out a solution before that date comes and this would be a non-issue.

Now fast forward to the beginning of this year 2022: I think it finally hit me that this situation is rapidly becoming dire and just ignoring it and pretending ""they"" (whoever that even is) is going to come to the rescue and magically make water appear shouldn't be part of my retirement plans. So, even though the real estate market basically ground to a halt this year I ended up selling two of the properties below market just to get rid of them, and I am trying to come up with a new alternate retirement plan. I never thought in a million years I would be factoring in ""running out of water"" into my retirement plans, it almost seems comical because I was born and raised here and water was never a thought. But this is really happening.... and I feel like it would now be foolish to pretend it isn't.

So….my “kind of” new plan is to move into the third property (which is a townhouse in Las Vegas) and see if that would work for my retirement and if so just take it year by year and monitor the water situation.  The payment is low enough and I have enough cash with the proceeds of the places I sold that I could make it work.  But, I still feel like I should prepare for the possibility that if the water really does run out, or at least gets so low that my water bill gets to $1000 per month just to shower and flush the toilet (which seems like it would be the first step before actually running out of water), what then?  My retirement home would presumably be worth a lot less and maybe not even sellable, so I would have to consider it a total loss and I would have to leave and whatever cash I had I would need to relocate and find new housing, which could end up being a rental like an apartment if I can't afford to buy something.  So I think, ok should I just plan for that now while I am still working and have income so I can prepare for it better financially?  I really have no idea where I would go although I was considering Tennessee or North Carolina as a Plan B, but the reality is that the last thing I want to do is completely scrap all of my plans and put all of my time and energy into scouting a new place to retire to, and actually moving where I don’t know anyone and having to start over again.

So that’s where I am.  It’s been somewhat distressing having to completely scrap a retirement plan that I have been working on for the last 10 years to achieve, but I feel like I have no choice.

retirement,"Married with two young kids (both under six)in high COL area. Wife and I (both 40 years old) make a combined salary of approximately $500k in moderate stress corporate jobs. Owe just over $1M on a home valued at around $3M. No other debt. When my wife’s parents (mid 70s) die we expect to inherit rental properties that cash flow approximately $26k/month, plus a few hundred thousand in cash. There are no liens on the properties and they’re in good shape, located in same city as us. 

We currently max 401ks, HSA, FSA for day care expenses, and take advantage of our company ESPP plans. We have some money saved up in a rainy day fund, enough for six month of expenses or so. Live fairly frugally: cheap flights for modest hotel travel on vacations and have paid off our aging cars that are safe and reliable. 

Question: knowing the above would you look to accelerate retirement as soon as possible? We both enjoy what we do but I don’t think anything beats living each day for yourself.

retirement,"Do any of you out there have any advice or suggestions for someone in my situation, something I may need to know about or you've learned from painful experience?

I'm 64, divorced, live with my widowed father who is 88 and has dementia and short-term memory loss. He can still be at home by himself, but his condition is slowly deteriorating and will reach the stage where someone needs to be at home all day. I've worked as a receptionist for the last 10 years, but since I have severe OA (osteoarthritis), I can no longer sit at a desk for another year, so I'm taking early retirement due to my own physical health and my father's mental health. I'll be his caregiver, no one else in our family is available and I can't handle my job much longer anyway.

So far I've applied for Social Security but am hoping I can get my ex-husband's SS as the monthly amount would be higher. How does the SS determine that even if I requested it? I wonder if my OA would qualify for SSI since I can't work any more (unable to sit/stand for long periods of time). I've been checking into dental insurance because my employer will no longer be paying (I'm trying to get as much dental work done as possible before leaving), very confusing to me--I'm not used to paying for it. Since I was in the military, I can go to a VA clinic until I can get Medicare next September. My 401-K is only about $20,000 and I don't want to touch it unless absolutely necessary. We live in an old doublewide mobile home that's paid for and my folks bought the lot. Dad doesn't charge me anything, I pay my own expenses and all the groceries, so I've paid off all my debts except a dental bill. Since my ex-spouse was career military, I get his monthly VA pension which totals around $1000 (if I outlive him, I'm screwed).

Is there anything else I could be or should be applying for, any benefits I may not know about? What do you do for dental insurance? Sometimes I wonder if paying up front is cheaper than going through insurance. I wonder if I would be eligible for Medicaid? I'm in North Carolina, by the way. I'm afraid I might be overlooking something. I need to have everything in order before I retire.

retirement,"I'm planning our finances for the first couple of years of retirement, and one of the topics is long-term capital gains.  I'm embarrassed to say I never really gave it much thought during our working years (we almost never sold anything anyway).  But, if I'm understanding this correctly, I'm shocked (in a good way).  

From what I'm reading, as long as our taxable income is under the Capital Gains threshold (which obviously varies by tax filing status), then we don't pay any capital gains tax.  And capital gains, themselves, do not count towards that threshold.  So, does that mean that I could sell every asset that I have and pay no taxes on the profit?  If a multi-millionaire can choose one year to not have taxable income (if dividends and interest and such don't exceed the limit by themselves), then he can sell stocks and mutual funds that he's owned for decades and effectively reset the basis for free?

For us, I was thinking of keeping our taxable income at $83,350 or under, which is the 0% capital gains bracket.  If we needed another $50k to spend, for example, I could sell some after-tax stocks and pay no tax to make up the difference.  But is there any reason not to sell **all** of our after tax stocks and mutual funds, if it's all 0% capital gains?  I'm aware of the 30 day wash rule, but I could just sell 1/12 of our after-tax funds each month and wait 30 days before re-investing in the same thing to spread out the risk of being out of the market during a bull rally.  We're not collecting social security yet, so the ability to reset the basis of every stock/mutual fund we've purchased over the last 30 years seems too good to be true.",t2_5l0mmopp,0,Capital Gains Question - 1st year of retirement,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,zj0xt9,True,--ThereIsNoSpoon--,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/zj0xt9/capital_gains_question_1st_year_of_retirement/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/zj0xt9/capital_gains_question_1st_year_of_retirement/,17887.0,1670780138,0.0,,False,1670780154,1670780155,2022-12-11 17:35:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"Getting fired before retirement is an unfortunate thing. But according to a [research](https://www.pfwhizz.com/getting-fired-before-retirement/) ""Around 56 percent of American people aged 50 or more lose their job at least once before retirement.”  So, It is not rare at all. At least not in the United States. But what to do if you get [fired before retirement](https://www.pfwhizz.com/getting-fired-before-retirement/)? 

If your age is below 60 and you get fired before retirement then you must do these to protect your interests

* If you are able to work then look for new employment. Because no matter how much money you have on your hand, it can still be short due to rising inflation. 
* Apply for unemployment benefits immediately after getting fired before retirement. 
* Don’t take your pension fund from your employer in cash without consulting a tax accountant or tax attorney. Otherwise, you might end up facing serious tax penalties. 
* Don’t withdraw lump sum from your 401(k). If you do then you might face tax penalties. 
* Consult with a financial advisor for the management of your pension fund. 
* If your healthcare is tied with your employer and you have a family, take advantage of COBRA Health insurance. Otherwise, find a private healthcare solution. 

If you are above 62 then 

* Apply for Social Security Benefits. Though how much you will get depends on your age. But still getting something is better than nothing. 
* Consult with a tax accountant before withdrawing any money from your 401(k) or pension fund to avoid tax penalties. 
* Find a financial expert or advisor for managing your retirement fund. 
* Sign up for medicare if you are above 65. If not then use COBRA if you have a family. Otherwise, find the most suitable private healthcare solution for you.

retirement," Longtime lurker, first post here. 

Age 61. Took early retirement package in June 2022 from employer of 20 years. Included severance of 12 months’ salary and retiree health benefits covering health insurance until age 65 with no premiums. No non-compete clause but will lose health benefits if I take on new employment elsewhere. 

Decided to explore viability of retiring early as I had planned on working until 63/64. Met with 3 CFP’s that offered combo of fee only/fee-based services. None of them were all that convincing to hire especially considering cost of services. I decided to also meet with Fidelity CFP where all retirement assets are held. Services are offered free of charge and allow for hybrid approach of DIY with assistance of CFP. 

1.8M in retirement assets held in IRA. 

Widowed in 2012 and began collecting SSA survivor benefits upon departure from employer that I can collect until age 67 at which time I will collect my SSA benefits. 

Moved 85% of IRA assets to cash in November 2021, remainder held in mutual index funds. – as result was not substantially impacted by recent downturn for the most part.

Fidelity CFP proposed the following: 

870k to SPIA – Single Premium Immediate Annuity held in IRA that will provide lifetime payout of monthly payments totaling $58,314/year. Payout guarantee of 20 years with remainder going to beneficiaries in the event of death before age 81. This will cover essential expenses. No COLA rider. Break-even point will be around age 75-77. 

Remainder of assets will be allocated to 52% stocks, 39% bonds and 9% to cash. Specific investments TBD. 

All these assumptions/variables plugged into Fidelity retirement calculator present a viable scenario for comfortable living in retirement. My main concern is pulling the trigger on the SPIA. It seems to be good option with early retirement scenario providing a long-playing field and Annual Payout Rate of 6.8%. I can allocate any amount into the SPIA, 870K is what Fidelity recommended. 

Thoughts on this proposal?

retirement,"If this isn’t the right reddit for this, I apologize.

To the point: I am a 27 year old Marine who, up until about a year ago, was planning on making the military and follow on government service my career. I am married with no kids, settled in an area that I do not intend to leave.

Last year I experienced a life changing medical diagnosis that meant I could no longer continue service. I’m not retiring from the military, but I’m very likely to receive 90-100% disability from the VA when I leave in a few months, which is effectively 2-4k a month untaxed. Free healthcare coverage for life, etc.

Obviously that’s not enough to just completely stop working, but it’s enough that I will never have to make “ends meet” again. My mortgage and expenses can be almost fully covered by any amount of disability I’m likely to receive.

I’m absolutely lost. I went from a career plan that I “needed” to make retirement, to now having absolutely no reason to work. It’s not a bad problem to have, and I’m very grateful that my diagnosis means an unexpected financial windfall, but now what?

I have no interest in making millions or being in high stress environments anymore. I have access to the GI Bill, which means free education at public colleges, but have no idea what to use it for and already have a BA.

I guess my question, for those of you who are retired, is how are you managing? If you could suddenly be 27 again in my shoes, what would you do?

retirement,"My spouse and I are debating the best way to withdraw money from our 65/35 stock/bond investment portfolio each year.  We are 51/47, retired for 3 years, and we have seen our living expenses come in under the 3.5% withdrawal guideline of our overall portfolio.

The question is, do we keep withdrawing 3.5% each year as originally planned to ""de-risk"" our portfolio each year even if we don't need it, thus having extra liquidity we could splurge on nicer things like nicer vacations?  Or, is it wiser to keep that money invested in stocks/bonds and thus perhaps drive more portfolio growth for possible later large expenses, such as health needs or unexpected items?

Granted, inflation weakens unspent withdrawn cash (we mitigate that a little via conservative investments like CDs &amp; Treasuries) but there is a nice feeling to seeing cash easily accessible in case of a health emergency or a severe market downturn given how long our portfolio needs to last us.

retirement,"Hi,

I’m new here and not sure if this is where to pose the question…

I’m 61 and will be retiring next year. I’ve read conflicting info on taking SS vs IRA withdrawals. Even though I’m not at full retirement age until 67, the way my simple mind works it makes sense to take SS early because my IRA is (hopefully) growing in value. The less I have to draw from the IRA, the more it will grow. Am I way off base here?

Oh, and yes, I do have a wealth manager that I will talk to about this, but wanted to get your take.

retirement,"Many large employers offer health insurance for retired former employees.

They may offer group Medicare Advantage. These plans function like regular Medicare Advantage plans — they are managed by private companies, and they may be either health maintenance organization, or HMO, plans or preferred provider organization (PPO) plans.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 1 in 5 people who enrolled in an Advantage plan did so as members of a group in 2019. This figure more than doubled between 2010 and 2019.

retirement,"My dad (71) retired around 10 years ago, he was a hard working man from his youth right up until he took ill in his 60s. This illness was his heart going out of rythem, which caused weight gain and a whole bunch of other stuff. He was a farmer, and worked during the summer for the harvest ( this was his main job working with other men to help harvest their feed for the winter). From he retired he lost interest in everything. All he did was watch tv, eat sleep and repeat. For a brief period of time, he was kept busy when my siblings had kids, he would help babysit them while my siblings went to work, but thats all finished now since the kids are all in school.   
He always said when I was growing up that his ideal retirement would be to buy a camper van, drive around the country to fish, and have what he caught for his dinner. He loved fly fishing. However with his weight gain (hes around 380 lbs), he cant take part, I have tried to encourage him to loss weight but hes stuborn. And now he has grown tired of the TV which he watched daily for hours at a time. I DID introduce him to alexa last year, which he uses frequently now (it was nice for him to get a change from just tv non stop), and my sister bought him a kindle the year prior. He read the kindle non stop for 3 months and hasnt picked it up since as he is very picky on the books he enjoys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been wrecking my head for what to gift him this year that isnt just the same ole after shave set, pjs, slippers etc (he has mountains of this stuff), and I thought maybe if I got him a new hobby to get into. He often says his ""brain isnt what it used to be"", and gets fustrated when having to focus on math and whatnot, so I am coming here to ask you reddit! What have you/do you plan to take up when you retire? Preferably something that he can do while sitting (Due to his weight). I got him some jigsaws but he just kinda looked at me like I had 3 heads lol. 

I considered getting him an ipad (He dosnt use the internet, he has a old flip phone for communication ,cant text etc), but I really think something off screen would be great for him",t2_11pn4h,0,What hobby did you/will you take up when your retired?,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,z7flhh,True,supercave93,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/z7flhh/what_hobby_did_youwill_you_take_up_when_your/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/z7flhh/what_hobby_did_youwill_you_take_up_when_your/,17728.0,1669686039,0.0,,False,1669686052,1669817418,2022-11-29 01:40:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"My backstory is that I have been with my current employer for over 30 years.  Two years ago all employees were sent home to work from home because of the pandemic.  We will be returning to the office (part-time) in January 2023. I can retire mid-next year at 62 with a pension that is about 1/3rd of my current salary.  My plan was to retire and immediately start drawing down my TIRA before my wife and I start pulling SS in about 3 years.  My goal was to try to minimize taxes for a few years.

I am having second thoughts because my job is sooo very easy and management is happy with my performance.  I plan to move out of state so I would be able to continue to work full time from home, should I decide to stay on. The difference between working from home and being retired in my home is next to nothing, but I would be giving up high 5 figures in pay to retire.  My job is nearly stress-free. BTW, I spent about 20 of those 30+ years traveling for business so I have morphed into a homebody. Travel no longer holds much importance to me.

retirement,"Hello! I(24f) am writing this because I am unsure how to proceed when it comes to helping my grandparents with their  retirement planning. 

My grandparents are immigrants who moved here about 12 years ago and are currently US citizen. They had both been working until my grandpa could no longer do so two years ago. My grandma is the only one working and paying the rent for their apartment among other things. She used to have about 20k saved up but my mother who is highly financially irresponsible borrowed that money so she could put a down payment on a home. She also used my grandmother as a co-signer for the home. It all happened a year ago. 
I am worried because I can see my grandmother slowing down and I anticipate that in a year or two she will not be able to work anymore. I’ve already started the process of applying for social security benefits which she does qualify for, though it is only around a few hundreds dollars now. But I know that soon enough she will need a place to stay, as they won’t be able to afford to pay rent anymore. 
I’ve read somewhere on this sub that being a fo-owner of a house could complicate the process and negatively impact how much help she can get from the state. We are in Maryland by the way. 
I am thinking that we need to make sure my mother takes off her name off the deed of the house asap even though she wouldn’t hopefully retire until maybe two years from now. 
Has anyone gone through something similar? What could I do now and what should I look out for in order to make sure that they don’t encounter any major issues down the line. 
I am their sole advocate and it’s a lot of responsibility and I would really really appreciate your help!

retirement,"I've put together a spreadsheet to forecast our retirement.  The plan is to be able to retire in 7 years and, at this point, I'm focused solely on the 401k portion (not real estate, SS, pension, nor anything else).

I'm trying to be conservative on the numbers in the hopes that my actual numbers will be better than my forecast, so I'm going with 4% inflation throughout our retirement years.  I ***think*** the historical average is closer to 3% and that includes some big numbers from the 1970s and 1980s.

Anyhow, with that 4% inflation rate, I'm assuming a 6% draw and 6% return on investment.  With this, I've run it for 35 years, putting us well into our 90s, and I'm getting an ending balance of $224,000 when starting at $938,000.  Does this seem correct or am I calculating something incorrectly?  **((starting balance + interest) - inflation) - withdrawal**

When factoring in SS and pension, we'd be living off income of roughly $80,000 and above until we hit approximately 80 years old.  In our 90s, we'd still be looking at an income of at least $65,000.  At that point, I'm sure it'll be mostly healthcare costs as travel and leisure activities will have diminished greatly.  This is all  at 2022 dollars and doesn't account for COLAs and doesn't include any savings or real estate - just 401k, SS, and pension.

Again, I'm not asking if I'm saving enough or if those numbers will be sufficient to cover expenses, I just want to make sure I'm using the correct formulas in calculating a starting balance of $938,000 with 6% interest, 4% inflation, and a 6% draw will result in a balance of $224,000 after 35 years.  Assuming that is correct, I'll continue doing my research and tweak the numbers accordingly to account for actual expenses/needs.

retirement,"I’m 57 and my partner is 72. He retired in 2015 and I retired this year. We’re not married due to my own fears long ago and have been together for about 25 years. 

He made a pretty good salary when I met him and being with him, aside from loving him and enjoying doing things together, meant to me that I had succeeded in making a long transition out of being with alcoholics and drug addicts and living in poverty to a safe middle-class life. He has plenty of money in retirement and I retired early in order to do retirement things like travel with him. It meant I’d become a little more financially dependent on him which was fine with him and with me after I got used to the idea. I have an independent streak. 

I’ve been able to afford my retirement life. I’m frugal and don’t need much. Looking into the distant future I had little to fear. 

My father died only 3 months after my retirement date. Suddenly I’m in transition into being quite wealthy. There was one day of elation when I realized the level of security I suddenly had and then it turned into fear and anxiety. I know how to scrimp and save. I know how to be the dependent person in a relationship. It is different to be so wealthy. I don’t know what to do with the money. I feel like I should not do things with it to benefit myself, I should only try to make it grow and ensure it makes its way to my nieces and nephews (I have no children). I don’t feel I deserve it. It feels wasteful to buy things with it. I’m so used to my partner paying for everything I can’t figure out how things should work now. Should I pay when we go out? Should I pay for household furniture? What if I bought my own house? Would he think I’m going to leave him? What if I bought a cabin, something not intended as investment property, something that’s just mine? Wouldn’t spending money that way be wrong? Should he leave the house to someone else instead of me since there’s really no need to take care of me anymore? Taking care of others is important to him and I’m sure this is hard for him too. A balance of power has changed. We are more equal now financially. 

This is a weird transition. I’ll hire a financial planner, cpa and a lawyer to create a trust and deal with the dollars. It’s the psychological stuff that’s messing with my mind. Who the hell am I anymore? I was so future-oriented for so long, striving to improve, saving for the future, and now the future is here. How can this feel like such a terrible thing?

A- They gave me ""covenant not to sue"" in exchange for 4wks paid leave. They are only offering this to the 6 folks that are planning to retire. Sounds fishy. 

B- I have vacation and sick leave saved up and will be paid out about $25k (my plans are to put $20k of that in a 401k before Dec 31st).

It has always been the routine to allow employees to retire, quit work for at least 30 days, and then rehire them. The 30 days is a requirement of our state retirement system. At that time I will start receiving a pension check and still continue to work for the city, also most of my regular paycheck will go into the 401k to max it out and avoid taxes.

So this has been my plan for years and been talking about this with HR and management, and noone has had any issues with this. As I said it has been a routine for a lot of folks.

I feel like my retirement plans are getting screwed just at the time I'm retiring.

From the city's viewpoint, they are having to cut expenses due to the loss of about $1M in revenue of a $30M budget, a large customer has shut down.

I feel a law suit is justified, but they have never been any obligation for them to hire me back. 

What can I do? What are some magic words that I can throw around to help this situation (age discrimination...)

It has always been that the City may not have enough money for things we need (firetruck...), but they always have money for what they want ($250k to landscape city hall...).

(I could retire, get the payout, collect my pension, and then find another job.

1. Is a Backdoor IRA still okay in 2022? 

2. Once I fund the traditional IRA account, do I also have to invest those funds through the traditional account prior to converting them to the Roth account? Or can I convert them before investing, to avoid earnings. 

3. How long should I wait to convert to a Roth account once funded. 

4. Once the conversion is complete, my traditional IRA account will have a $0 balance. Can I keep the traditional account open for doing the same process the following year? Can I use the same Roth accountto repeat the process the following year as well?

(tl:dr) full post here if you want for context: 

SAN DIEGO — After 20 distinguished years in the fire service, and the last few years serving the city of San Diego Fire and Rescue, Fire Captain II Royal Huff has announced his early retirement. 

Huff, 38, will step down Dec. 30, 2022. 

“I’ll miss working with the guys around the station and crews,” said Huff, standing proudly next to Truck 28 and his crew. “I’ll miss working with all the other captains and chiefs in the agencies around San Diego. It’s been a long and wonderful ride.” 

He began his fire service career in 2002 with Columbia Fire Protection District as a volunteer firefighter. The following fire season, he was employed as a seasonal firefighter for the California Department of Forestry, (now California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire). Serving as a firefighter II until 2012.

In 2012, he promoted to Engineer and transferred to the San Luis Obispo Unit in Cal Fire, eventually promoting to Fire Captain and developing the lifeguard program in Pismo Beach. During his tenure, he initiated and oversaw twelve programs, sitting on the board for both union and local veteran affairs with the City of Pismo Beach. Huff and his wife, a San Diego local, relocated back home after a family emergency in 2020. 

In 2020, Huff joined the SDFD as a Fire Captain I. Chief Stowell, Department Chief of San Diego Fire and Rescue, stated the department was honored to have an experienced fire officer join his ranks with such passion for the community. Huff was a good fit for the department, though he stated he could not get used to how large the department felt. 

“That’s part of the thing in a large department like this, you meet a new face almost every shift,” Huff said. “When an emergency happens to in this city, it seems like you either know them, or somebody you know knows them. It is a very different feeling than Cal Fire.” 

As fire captain for the city, Huff sat on three committees for health and safety. He formalized the community paramedic program and quite a few homeless outreach programs that found immediate traction. Chief Stowell mentioned that whenever Huff was on a committee, the project would always find success. 

When asked about retirement, Huff said he had already started working for a community victim program alongside a company called 1-800-BOARDUP. ""Not much retirement for me, I cannot hardly keep myself still. The board up company gives me an opportunity to serve the community and still work with all 18 local fire departments in San Diego County. We help families and victims pick up the pieces when the fire department and crews have to return to service. I could not imagine a better retirement gig."" Huff said he plans to stay busy in his role as director of emergency services with 1-800-BOARDUP and to do some traveling with his wife of 10 years. 

San Diego Fire and Rescue has seen a wave of early retirements after COVID-19 impacted the department two years ago. The retirement wave seems to be easing off a bit, but Huff is one of six early retirements coming in December. Huff stated the department is making good progress towards retaining personnel this last year by engaging in a conversation about competitive pay and benefits for the firefighters. ""If things go as planned, the majority of good experienced officers and firefighters will stay with SDFD until they reach full retirement. For me, I have some personal obligations that prevent me from putting in another 10 years."" 

According to Huff’s wife, a registered nurse a sharp memorial, they both take care of a dependent family member on their time off. She stated, “I am thankful he is retiring early, between our schedules, it was almost impossible to ensure we had full time medical supervision for my family.”",t2_uedfcb3t,0,San Diego Fire Captain Announces Early Retirement,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,False,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,yywt18,True,sandiegofirerescue,,0,False,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/yywt18/san_diego_fire_captain_announces_early_retirement/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/yywt18/san_diego_fire_captain_announces_early_retirement/,17601.0,1668811402,0.0,,False,1668811412,1669820300,2022-11-18 22:43:22,self,,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7A5pRH4WFrCMmE4jH8Fn4WfuKUEklPl4UwdkExrFYJk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b5691a91e5184a47cde426af32ebee57a21b27f5', 'width': 1023, 'height': 731}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7A5pRH4WFrCMmE4jH8Fn4WfuKUEklPl4UwdkExrFYJk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a786d37ebef563183466d0e6f1f82f13bb3593', 'width': 108, 'height': 77}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7A5pRH4WFrCMmE4jH8Fn4WfuKUEklPl4UwdkExrFYJk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aea91c3e59430535b0485e05a1060664cf03e8f3', 'width': 216, 'height': 154}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7A5pRH4WFrCMmE4jH8Fn4WfuKUEklPl4UwdkExrFYJk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d74ec02205bf98c5464773cdc50e0c3a9b6381f', 'width': 320, 'height': 228}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7A5pRH4WFrCMmE4jH8Fn4WfuKUEklPl4UwdkExrFYJk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f40c109dc48f703eb22b8722b83be2a1f06698a5', 'width': 640, 'height': 457}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/7A5pRH4WFrCMmE4jH8Fn4WfuKUEklPl4UwdkExrFYJk.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dad2f31567e366e2e7783069ef3f659041de9a2f', 'width': 960, 'height': 685}], 'variants': {}, 'id': '8CRltzF0XniU1h84f85Q44TUwAeGWWcmlj_9caS-y5I'}], 'enabled': False}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this post, we'll go over everything you need to know about Side Shuffles. We'll discuss what they are, how to get started, and the different types of Side Shuffle out there.

So, what are you waiting for? Let's get started!

What Are Side Shuffle?

A Side Shuffle is a way to make extra money by doing something you love. It can be anything from freelancing to starting your own business.

The great thing about side hustles is that they allow you to be creative and flexible. You can choose the type of work you want to do, and you can work on your own schedule.

How to Get Started

If you're interested in starting a side hustle, the first step is to figure out what you want to do. There are a lot of different options out there, so it's important to find something that interests you.

Once you've decided on a Side Shuffle, the next step is to set up your business. This may include setting up a website or creating a social media presence. You'll also need to decide on a business name and register with the government.

The final step is to start marketing your business.

But looking at the historical performance of bond funds, I don't see the value. Wouldn't holding individual bonds (I-bonds, T-bills, municipal, corporate) provide more stable growth and greater certainty when facing potentially turbulent markets?

retirement,"I have 12k in a traditional IRA right now and 2k in a Roth. I want to convert the traditional into my Roth as it would benefit me more in 21 years when I'm 59 years old. The tax bracket limit for me would be up to 89k and I'm probably going to make 70k this year at my job so that's around 82k so I think I'm good. My question is how much would that effect my return money? I usually get back around $2,500. Would my return be less because of the more reported income? 

My next question is about holding stocks during a conversion. I have to fill out paperwork and add all my stocks and percentages along with leaving cash in the account to be taken out for taxes. So the question is what would happen if I send the paper work and then say a few days later the market tanks and I want to get out of all my positions and sell? Or say I see a really good buying opportunity and decided to contribute 2k to my Roth from savings to buy some dips. Is that kind of thing still manageable during the waiting period?

retirement,"
So, for years I always thought I wanted to get a nice government job with a pension. Next year I am supposed to be starting a job with the state which is going to offer me 457(b) and 401(A) plans. 

After doing research into the plans, I am starting to think my current 401(K) is much better, especially if I combined it with a Roth IRA plan. Convince me that I am wrong. 

My current private employer 

* 2% of our annual Gross Pay  
* 100% match up to 6% of our contributions.   
\- So that's a grand total of 8% match of my pay annually. I am 3 years away from being 100% vested.  


My future government employer  


1.  Money Purchase Pension Plan - 401(A)  
"" \[COMPANY\] will contribute 1% of your base wages.  The contribution will increase 1% each year of service up to 5%.  Subsequent years will continue based on gross wages""  
   
 \- I cannot contribute to this plan  
\- 3 years of employment until 100% vested

2. Deferred Compensation Plan - 457(b) -   
""You may contribute between 2% and 50% of your salary up to a maximum of 100% of includible compensation or $20,500, whichever is less in 2022""   
\- No employer contribution match

The 401(A) seems great if I didn't want to contribute money, but I seem to be missing out on 3% of ""free"" money I currently earn from my current employer. With both having the same earning potential, I am questioning the career change here.

This isn't what I thought a pension was, and this so called pension is merely an employer funded savings account it seems.",t2_156l04,0,Which is the better employer offered retirement account for me?,[],r/retirement,False,6.0,,,,True,False,dark,1.0,,public,0.0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,1,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,text,6.0,,text,self.retirement,False,,,False,True,True,False,False,[],[],False,True,False,False,,[],,,t5_2tgdb,,yxetwy,True,RockDodo,,0,True,all_ads,False,False,,/r/retirement/comments/yxetwy/which_is_the_better_employer_offered_retirement/,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/yxetwy/which_is_the_better_employer_offered_retirement/,17574.0,1668654592,0.0,,False,1668654604,1669820843,2022-11-17 03:09:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

retirement,"What is the best sequence of withdrawals from within a single RRSP account?

My RRSP portfolio has a diverse mix of GIC's, Stocks - including Dividends, Mutuals, ETF's etc.

Now that I need to convert them to an income stream for our retirement, I am wondering what the best strategy is.

1) I could take a little bit (4% rule) out of each one.

2) A financial advisor suggesting we sell the GIC's (5% return, 1 year) first, rather than the Mutual fund which has lost 17% over the past 12 months.  This made no sense to me.

3) My inclination is to start by selling the lowest performing stocks first, keeping the higher performing (and higher risk) stocks.   The mutual fund that lost 17% is a balanced fund, that was producing an annual average of 4%.

4) Preserve the dividend producing stocks until the end.  Half of the stocks are producing over 5% per year in dividends.  Many have dipped as much as 20% below purchase value, but continue to produce good dividends.

The premise is that in general we are too comfortable and that discomfort and challenge are important to health. You may or may not agree but the resonated with me. I do think that I want to do something difficult/challenging but nothing is really coming to mind. Throughout life my primary challenges were school, work, parenting, relocating cross country several times. Since retirement I have started new hobbies ( guitar, quilting, golf) but these are not really challenging in the way the book describes.

retirement,"We've put ourselves in a pickle. After years of talking about doing it, we (Husband 32 and I 32) jumped on buying a house with my spouse's family.

It's been just over a year, we can't stand living together, and my husband and I are swimming in bills from trying to cover everything. 

So we listed the house for sale, but it keeps nagging at me - I have retirement money put aside, not the whole 80k but a good chunk of it. Wound it be a completely asinine idea to try to pay of MIL and keep the house?

retirement,"Awhile back I posted about a dilemma -- accept a promotion with a big raise or retire. I decided to retire and here's why. I had a lengthy back and forth with my boss, going over all the aspects of the job, expectations, timing and resources. I was given more time to think about it and during that time, one of my long-term employees had a massive stroke. She had vacillated over retiring for the past two years. I decided I may not have as much money but I will never get back the time. I don't want to waste any more my healthy senior years stressing over work. If it means I'm living more frugally, so be it. I feel very happy with my decision.

retirement,"Over the last several years, the 60/40 portfolio has been a fool proof strategy to achieving solid investment returns while minimizing risk. The strategy involves investing 60% in broad equity markets (domestic and international) and 40% in broad fixed income markets. Historically speaking, before this year, these asset classes had correlations close to zero and even negative, meaning the performance of each asset is independent of the other. When you combine two assets that are less than perfectly correlated with each other, risk is reduced. This is the concept behind the 60/40 portfolio, that is, smoother (less volatile) returns.

This relationship has been different in 2022 though. With inflation soaring, the Fed has been forced to rapidly increase interest rates to fight it, and has yields rising at a pace not seen since the 1980s. Bonds, which are quoted in yields, have declined in value due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields. We have also seen stocks decline during this same period of time which has called into question if the bond/stock neutral relationship we have observed in the past will persist into the future. A 60/40 portfolio made up of 60% ACWI (World Stock index) and 40% AGG (US Total Bond Index) has a performance of -19.88% YTD. ACWI performance is -23% YTD (not including dividends) and AGG is about -16% YTD (not including interest payments). So much for the zero correlation!

In hindsight, the 60/40 portfolio has not been a solid strategy this year. When we look forward though, there are reasons to expect bonds to perform more like bonds. US treasuries which are virtually risk-free offer a 4% yield right now and could be attractive seeing we have slowing growth and could potentially be facing lower than average equity returns for the foreseeable future.

Because I am so interested in this relationship, starting with the month of November, I will monitor the monthly performance of the 60/40 portfolio vs. the S&amp;P 500 and will post it once distribution data is available. Stay tuned…

retirement,"Hey all so just looking for input to make sure I haven't fully lost my mind. 

I'm 32 years old, have worked largely in consulting for the big 4 after the military, got my undergrad and MBA as well. In addition I have started 6 seperate businesses 2 of which have done exceptionally well, 1 I still manage. I also have converted almost all of my success into assets. 

I plan on leaving my very good job next year to retire in Thailand, I am already in the middle of a few home sales and have sold others earlier this year. As for consistent income when moving (I didn't bother with a 401k) I collect about 4k a month in disability and another 6.5k from properties that I'm not selling. My company I run with two people and neither of us take an owners draw but have expense accounts with regular deposits. 

Everyone tells me I shouldn't leave my day job (pays about 260k a year) as I'm on track to hit partner probably in 3 years, but I'm just so epically burnt out. My prime market was APAC and all I want to do is leave to live a more simple life. Money should never be an issue and I'll still be active within the company that I run. 

My question(s) - am I too young to do this? Am I making a giant mistake in throwing away a good career track?

retirement,"I was on vacation all last week. Didn’t do anything special—hung out at home, slept in, did some chores, read a couple of books, had lunch with friends. 

It was freakin’ awesome. 

Came back to work today and was faced with the usual work stuff, plus we are in the process of closing our office. Throwing away lots of things that I’ve been hanging onto, that seemed important. 

I was suddenly struck with this feeling that I have completely wasted my life. I can’t even explain it.  Lately I’ve been more and more aware (especially after a recent birthday…) that life is really short. Today it hit me that I’ve spent 30+ years shuffling literal as well as electronic papers and have deluded myself into thinking it was important. It wasn’t. I’ve watched people quit and retire, and there’s barely a ripple to the organization. I’ll quit or die and be replaced easily, I’m sure. 

I’ve always known this, intellectually, but today I just really felt it in my heart. In my soul.

retirement,"My family member retired early this year just as the markets tanked. Not only did his stock ETFs get slaughtered, but his ""safe"" bond fund ETFs also fell 10-15%. All the bond funds were those typical total market bond funds the experts recommend with durations of 5-7 years.

In retrospect, it seems to me somewhat silly that anyone would have invested money into bond funds with medium/long duration during the 2010-2020 timeframe, given that interest rates were near 0. My assumption is that interest rates could only go up, and when they did, the bond funds would would only go down. I suppose it is possible that interest rates could have gone negative, which would have made bond funds go up. It's happened in other countries. 

It seems to me that back in 08-10, when the Fed announced it was going to drop interest rates, it might have been smart to start moving out of these medium/long duration bond funds and to park the money somewhere else. Such as cash, short term CDs, short term T-bills, or short-term bond funds.

Of course, you would now have the opposite problem today, interest rates are rising and you have to figure out how to time the market to move your money back into medium duration bond funds.

I'm a buy and hold investor. I don't really like the idea of timing the market or making changes based on market conditions. But I suppose I might include interest rates as somewhat of an exception. I don't really know.

I suppose I am not very sold on these bond funds. It seems to me a 5 year treasury bond ladder would be a simple solution instead of risking major losses in a bond fund ETF when interest rates rise.

retirement,"I have made a mistake. I went out and found some volunteer opportunities. It is too soon. People found out what I did for a living and now they basically want me to do what I used to get paid to do for free. I am happy to donate a little of my time to a good cause in return for a little physical activity moving things around and a chance to say hello to nice people also moving things around.

I feel like I was ambushed. I signed up for regular volunteer jobs like everybody else and then was asked to come to a meeting where I thought it was a meeting of all the new volunteers but I was the only new one there, and this other work was suddenly sprung on me.

I think I am going to have to say no to any volunteering so they won't keep trying to get more from me. It is just too soon. I earned my freedom. It's sort of heartbreaking they never paid me what I was worth at my job and now here I am with people trying to get me to do the same work for free. I don't think that is right.

retirement,"So I began working at my job 9 years ago. I ""vested"" at 8 years. According my my retirement scenario website at my work, I am ""eligible to retire on June 2027"". I am currently 29, and going to be 30 this December. I plan to keep this my only job my whole life and I wondered what happens when I want to retire at say, 45 or 55? Does the IRS care about me allowing myself to retire, or do they just care about my lump sum payment I plan to take out at the same time? Maybe I'm mixing my information with social security retirement stuff...can someone please clarify?

retirement,"1.	Make up your mind- The first and the most important step in being retirement ready is to make up your mind to be retirement ready. Unless you are determined to take the first step towards retirement planning, it won’t get done. You have to stop procrastinating and push yourself to get started, today.

2.	Set your Retirement Fund target- Before you start investing, set your target. How much corpus you need at the time of retirement and how much you need to save to reach that goal. Before you start your journey, set the destination.
How much Fund do you need at Retirement?... Check Here (http://www.pensiongenie.com/calculator2.html)

3.	Pay yourself first- Once you know how much to save to reach the set target, before you pay your monthly bills, set aside the required amount from your pay cheque and invest. Manage your monthly household budget with the available balance. 

4.	Choose long term investment vehicles- Retirement being a long term goal, you should plan it with such investment options which have the potential to grow your wealth in long term and put some restrictions on intermediate withdrawals. NPS is one such vehicle designed specifically for retirement planning.

5.	Be a disciplined investor- Being a disciplined investor enhances your chances of getting success and pays off in the long run. Well begun is half done, but following a disciplined investment strategy works wonders. Keep contributing to your retirement account and reach your milestone in a comfortable manner.

6.	Re-balance the Asset Allocation periodically- With time, your portfolio’s current asset allocation will deviate from the original asset allocation, which might not be suitable to your risk profile. Hence, you should review the asset allocation of your portfolio, at least once a year, and re-balance, if required.

Check the Right Asset Allocation for you (http://www.pensiongenie.com/rightAssetAllocationManager.html?p=5)

retirement,"There appears to be little info on deferral/contribution limits for an employer plan that offers a suite of 401(a), 403(b) and 457(b) plans.  After plenty of reading and meeting with a CPA, investment company and my HR, it is time to share my learning.

My original research focused on the maximum annual deferral limits. I recently discovered I can contribute to out 457 and have some temporary means to do so, so I [looked up the contribution limits of a 457.](https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Retirement-Topics-457b-Contribution-Limits)

[This investopedia article helped](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011316/457-plan-contribution-limits-2016.asp) me start to understand the relationship between the plans.

The limit of any particular portion of the account is [documented by the IRS clearly.](https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/COLA-Increases-for-Dollar-Limitations-on-Benefits-and-Contributions) 


[This website](https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/How-Much-Salary-Can-You-Defer-if-You%E2%80%99re-Eligible-for-More-than-One-Retirement-Plan)  made me think my contribution to the 457 does Not impact the annual limit of the 401/403 plans:

* ""The amount you can defer (including pre-tax and Roth contributions) to all your plans (not including 457(b) plans)...""

* ""457(b) plan participants:
You have a separate deferral limit if you’re also eligible to participate in a 457(b) plan. See 457(b) Plan Contribution Limits. It is not combined with your deferrals made to a 403(b) or other plans.""

It doesn't discuss the $53,000 annual limit but implies the answer that advisers have is correct, but even they seemed to be learning about this particular situation.  My employer contribution won't be enough to hit that $53k limit so I'm all set.  Here's the summary of deferrals:

* employer match will be over $10k

* my 401/403 contribution can be $24k ($18k + $6k catchup)

* my 457 contribution can be $24k ($18k + $6k catchup for governmental 457)

* my annual deferral limit for the 401/403 is $59k ($53k + $6k catchup)

* I'm not sure if my 457b plan allows for the [special catch-up] (https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/How-Much-Salary-Can-You-Defer-if-You%E2%80%99re-Eligible-for-More-than-One-Retirement-Plan)

* I am not eligible for the [15 year catchup] (https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/How-Much-Salary-Can-You-Defer-if-You%E2%80%99re-Eligible-for-More-than-One-Retirement-Plan) as I've not been employed there for 15 years.

retirement,"Hi there, quick question on what assumptions to make for future income needs in retirement as most calculators keep moving the carrot in my opinion; in my mid 40's for reference.

I've always saved a slice of my income into a 401k since day 1 and have pushed my allocations to max my 401k, roth, hsa and IRA (for the spouse) the last few years. As such, I believe we're more than on track over the long haul at the moment. 

In addition, we pay a mortgage (with aspiration plans to kill that a few years) a 529, and are just mildly accruing cash overall on regular expenses.

Now the question, Today, as a single income household, we're saving, paying off, contributing something like 33+% of gross income via pre and post tax vehicles and comfortably live off the balance. In a retirement calculator, if I pump in my gross salary, it has a very large number and says we're only on track.  As we're living below our means a touch, is it more appropriate to estimate against a different salary level or is something akin to the 80% factor what this is all about (I was thinking some of that was tax base assumptions)?

Ultimately, when we were earlier in our working lives, the projected ""retirement figure"" was 1/3 lower; however, our expense basis has not significantly changed in the last 10 years.
